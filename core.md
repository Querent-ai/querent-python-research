# Lightweight RDF Graph Manipulation Library

Querent package, as an RDF graph manipulation library, doesn't inherently send data to external systems. Instead, it provides functionality to work with RDF graphs, including creating, updating, querying, and serializing graphs. How and where the data is sent is typically determined by the application that uses Querent.

Here are some common scenarios for sending data from Querent:

1. **Serialization:** Querent can serialize RDF data to various formats such as Turtle, JSON-LD, or RDF/XML. The serialized data can be saved to a file, sent via HTTP to another system, or used in other ways.

2. **Database Inserts:** If you are using Querent with a database system, you might use an adapter or bridge to send the RDF data to the database. In this case, the adapter would be responsible for mapping RDF data to database-specific queries or operations.

3. **HTTP Requests:** If you need to send RDF data to a remote service or a triple store, you can use standard HTTP requests to POST or PUT the data to the target service's RESTful endpoint. Querent's serialization capabilities can be helpful in creating the data payload for these requests.

4. **Message Queues:** For more complex or asynchronous data distribution, you might send RDF data as messages to a message queue or publish-subscribe system.

5. **In-Memory Data Sharing:** In some cases, you might use Querent within a single application and share RDF data between different parts of the application in memory.

The specific method you use to send data from Querent depends on your application's architecture and requirements. Querent provides the tools to work with RDF data, but it's up to your application to determine how and where that data should be sent or used. The choice of data transport and integration with external systems often involves creating custom solutions, such as adapters, bridges, or custom data processing pipelines.
