    An asyncio-based queue with some additional functionality.

    This queue allows you to put and get items asynchronously. It also supports marking items as done,
    joining the queue, and closing it with a sentinel value to signal worker exit.

    Example:
        queue = QuerentQueue()
        await queue.put(item)
        item = await queue.get()
        await queue.task_done()
        await queue.close()

    Args:
        None

    Attributes:
        queue (asyncio.Queue): The underlying asyncio queue.
