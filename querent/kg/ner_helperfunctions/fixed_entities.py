a substantial response in the downstream sectors of the Gulf Coastal Plain and ultimately
in the GoM. This relationship is illustrated in the deep-water basin by (1) a high accom-
modation and deposition of a shale interval when coarse-grained terrigenous material
was trapped upstream at the onset of the PETM, and (2) a considerable increase in sedi-
ment supply during the PETM, which is archived as a particularly thick sedimentary
section in  the deep-sea fans of the GoM basin. The Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) (ca. 56 Ma) was a rapid global warming event characterized by the rise of temperatures to5–9 °C (Kennett and Stott, 1991), which caused substantial environmental changes around the globe."""  # Insert your text here
