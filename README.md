## Introduction

Querent is designed to simplify and optimize data collection and processing workflows. Whether you need to scrape web data, ingest files, preprocess text, or create complex knowledge graphs, Querent offers a flexible framework for building and scaling these processes.

## Features

- **Collectors:** Gather data from various sources asynchronously, including web scraping and file collection.

- **Ingestors:** Process collected data efficiently with custom transformations and filtering.

- **Processors:** Apply asynchronous data processing, including text preprocessing, cleaning, and feature extraction.

- **Storage:** Store processed data in various storage systems, such as databases or cloud storage.

- **Workflow Management:** Efficiently manage and scale data workflows with task orchestration.

- **Scalability:** Querent is designed to scale horizontally, handling large volumes of data with ease.

## Getting Started

Let's get Querent up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### Installation

1. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
2. Install latest Querent Workflow Orchestrator package:

   ```bash
   pip install querent
   ```
  
3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
     python3 -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
   ```

## Usage

Querent provides a flexible framework that adapts to your specific data collection and processing needs. Here's how to get started:

1. **Configuration:** Set up collector, ingestor, and processor configurations as needed.

2. **Collecting Data:** Implement collector classes to gather data from chosen sources. Handle errors and edge cases gracefully.

3. **Processing Data:** Create ingestors and processors to clean, transform, and filter collected data. Apply custom logic to meet your requirements.

4. **Storage:** Choose your storage system (e.g., databases) and configure connections. Store processed data efficiently.

5. **Task Orchestration:** For large tasks, implement a task orchestrator to manage and distribute the workload.

6. **Scaling:** To handle scalability, consider running multiple instances of collectors and ingestors in parallel.

7. **Monitoring:** Implement monitoring and logging to track task progress, detect errors, and ensure smooth operation.

8. **Documentation:** Maintain thorough project documentation to make it easy for others (and yourself) to understand and contribute.

## Configuration

Querent relies on configuration files to define how collectors, ingestors, and processors operate. These files are typically located in the `config` directory. Ensure that you configure the components according to your project's requirements.

## Ease of Use

With Querent, creating scalable workflows with any LLM is just a few lines of code.

```python
import pytest
import uuid
from pathlib import Path
import asyncio

from querent.callback.event_callback_interface import EventCallbackInterface
from querent.common.types.ingested_tokens import IngestedTokens
from querent.common.types.ingested_code import IngestedCode
from querent.common.types.ingested_images import IngestedImages
from querent.common.types.ingested_messages import IngestedMessages
from querent.common.types.querent_event import EventState, EventType
from querent.common.types.querent_queue import QuerentQueue
from querent.core.base_engine import BaseEngine
from querent.querent.querent import Querent
from querent.querent.resource_manager import ResourceManager
from querent.collectors.collector_resolver import CollectorResolver
from querent.common.uri import Uri
from querent.config.collector.collector_config import FSCollectorConfig
from querent.ingestors.ingestor_manager import IngestorFactoryManager

# Create input and output queues
input_queue = QuerentQueue()
resource_manager = ResourceManager()


# Define a simple mock LLM engine for testing
class MockLLMEngine(BaseEngine):
    def __init__(self, input_queue: QuerentQueue):
        super().__init__(input_queue)

    async def process_tokens(self, data: IngestedTokens):
        if data is None or data.is_error():
            # the LLM developer can raise an error here or do something else
            # the developers of Querent can customize the behavior of Querent
            # to handle the error in a way that is appropriate for the use case
            self.set_termination_event()
            return
        # Set the state of the LLM
        # At any given point during the execution of the LLM, the LLM developer
        # can set the state of the LLM using the set_state method
        # The state of the LLM is stored in the state attribute of the LLM
        # The state of the LLM is published to subscribers of the LLM
        current_state = EventState(EventType.Graph, 1.0, "anything", "dummy.txt")
        await self.set_state(new_state=current_state)

    async def process_code(self, data: IngestedCode):
        pass

    async def process_messages(self, data: IngestedMessages):
        return super().process_messages(data)

    async def process_images(self, data: IngestedImages):
        return super().process_images(data)

    def validate(self):
        return True


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_example_workflow_with_querent():
    # Initialize some collectors to collect the data
    directory_path = "./tests/data/pdf4"
    collectors = [
        CollectorResolver().resolve(
            Uri("file://" + str(Path(directory_path).resolve())),
            FSCollectorConfig(root_path=directory_path, id=str(uuid.uuid4())),
        )
    ]

    # Connect to the collector
    for collector in collectors:
        await collector.connect()

    # Set up the result queue
    result_queue = asyncio.Queue()

    # Create the IngestorFactoryManager
    ingestor_factory_manager = IngestorFactoryManager(
        collectors=collectors, result_queue=result_queue
    )

    # Start the ingest_all_async in a separate task
    ingest_task = asyncio.create_task(ingestor_factory_manager.ingest_all_async())

    ### A Typical Use Case ###
    # Create an engine to harness the LLM
    llm_mocker = MockLLMEngine(input_queue)

    # Define a callback function to subscribe to state changes
    class StateChangeCallback(EventCallbackInterface):
        async def handle_event(self, event_type: EventType, event_state: EventState):
            print(f"New state: {event_state}")
            print(f"New state type: {event_type}")
            assert event_state.event_type == EventType.Graph

    # Subscribe to state change events
    # This pattern is ideal as we can expose multiple events for each use case of the LLM
    llm_mocker.subscribe(EventType.Graph, StateChangeCallback())

    ## one can also subscribe to other events, e.g. EventType.CHAT_COMPLETION ...

    # Create a Querent instance with a single MockLLM
    # here we see the simplicity of the Querent
    # massive complexity is hidden in the Querent,
    # while being highly configurable, extensible, and scalable
    # async architecture helps to scale to multiple querenters
    # How async architecture works:
    #   1. Querent starts a worker task for each querenter
    #   2. Querenter starts a worker task for each worker
    #   3. Each worker task runs in a loop, waiting for input data
    #   4. When input data is received, the worker task processes the data
    #   5. The worker task notifies subscribers of state changes
    #   6. The worker task repeats steps 3-5 until termination
    querent = Querent(
        [llm_mocker],
        resource_manager=resource_manager,
    )
    # Start the querent
    querent_task = asyncio.create_task(querent.start())
    await asyncio.gather(ingest_task, querent_task)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(test_example_workflow_with_querent())


```
