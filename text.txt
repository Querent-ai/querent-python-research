Glacier mass variations have a direct impact on some of the key components of the
global water cycle, including sea level rise and freshwater availability. Apart from being
one of the largest Himalayan glaciers, Gangotri is one of the sources of water for the
Ganges river, which has a considerable inﬂuence on the socioeconomic structure of a
largely over-populated catchment area accounting for ∼26% of India’s landmass. In this
study, we present the most recent assessment of the Gangotri glacier dynamics, combin-
ing the use of interferometric techniques on synthetic aperture radar data and sub-pixel
offset tracking on Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reﬂection Radiometer
(ASTER) satellite imagery. Results show that on average, the Gangotri glacier snout
has receded at a rate of 21.3 ± 3 m year−1 over a period of 6 years (2004–2010).
While glacier surface velocity near the snout is estimated to be between 24.8 ± 2.3 and
28.9 ± 2.3 m year−1, interior portions of the glacier recorded velocities in the range of
13.9 ± 2.3 to 70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1. Further, the average glacier surface velocity in the
northern (lower) portions (28.1 ± 2.3 m year−1) is observed to be signiﬁcantly lower
than in the southern (higher) portions (48.1 ± 2.3 m year−1) of the Gangotri glacier.
These values are calculated with an uncertainty of less than 5 m year−1. Results also
highlight a consistent retreat and non-uniform dynamics of the Gangotri glacier.

Introduction
The impact of climate change on glaciers of the world has been a topic of active concern
in recent times (Syed et al. 2007; Bagla 2009; Cogley et al. 2010). While glacial melt is a
major source of freshwater that contributes to global mean sea level rise (Meier et al. 2007;
Jacob et al. 2012), decreasing glacial mass has an impact on the freshwater resources of
some of the largest river basins in the world, including that of the Ganges (e.g. Kumar,
Singh, and Sharma 2005; Mall et al. 2006; Immerzeel, van Beek, and Bierkens 2010;
Kaser, Grosshauser, and Marzeion 2010). Fluctuations in the recession rate of glaciers dur-
ing recent years have initiated widespread discussions, especially in the context of global
warming and its effects (Dyurgerov and Meier 2005). Similar ice mass changes have also
been reported in the Garhwal region of the Himalayas (Kulkarni et al. 2005; Bhambri,
Bolch, and Chaujar 2011a, 2011b; Kulkarni et al. 2011; Bolch et al. 2012). However, the

status of the Gangotri glacier warrants further investigation, particularly in the context of
climate change resulting in continuous retreat, negative mass balance, and early melting of
seasonal snow cover (Negi et al. 2012).
Glaciers cover about 40,800 km2 of the Himalayan and Karakoram mountain region,
and are one of the main sources of water to some of the largest rivers in the world, including
the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Indus (Kulkarni et al. 2011; Bajracharya and Shrestha 2011;
Bolch et al. 2012). Approximately 10% of the summer discharge of the Ganges is attributed
to melt waters from glaciers (Barnett, Adam, and Letternmaier 2005; Jain, Agarwal, and
Singh 2007; Immerzeel, van Beek, and Bierkens 2010; Bolch et al. 2012). Rapid depletion
of glaciers has had adverse effects on the ﬂow regime of major Himalayan rivers, and can
even lead to catastrophic events such as glacial lake outbursts (Govindha 2010; Shrestha,
Eriksson, and Mool 2010; Ashraf, Naz, and Roohi 2012) and consequent ﬂooding in the
upper reaches of these rivers, affecting the lives of millions of people residing in the Indo-
Gangetic plains (Richardson and Reynolds 2000; Bolch et al. 2012).
In spite of their hydrologic, climatic, and socioeconomic signiﬁcance, opportunities for
precise and continuous monitoring of the Himalayan glaciers are limited by logistical and
terrain-induced difﬁculties. Observations of Earth’s surface using satellite data have proven
to be very useful in such monitoring; recent developments in high-resolution image acqui-
sition have facilitated more precise monitoring of glacier movement (Luckman, Quincey,
and Bevan 2007; Kumar, Venkataraman, and Hogda 2011; Kumar et al. 2011). Further,
satellite data enables a gross analysis of glacier mass budgets, overcoming some of the
problems of accessibility and sustainability of long-term measurements, that can later be
veriﬁed with ground-based surveys (Kumar et al. 2008). The potential of remote sensing
for glacier mass balance and velocity mapping has been demonstrated with optical (e.g.
Kääb 2005; Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker 2008), synthetic aperture radar (SAR) (e.g.
Luckman, Quincey, and Bevan 2007), and thermal infrared sensors (e.g. Nakawo, Yabuki,
and Sakai 1999), and elevation models (Bolch, Pieczonka, and Benn 2011), among others.
Developments in deriving ﬂow rates and monitoring Himalayan glacier retreat using optical
images have been made by Kääb (2005). However, this approach is sometimes limited by
weather, clouds, and shadows in areas of high relief.
In a novel approach, the current study presents one of the most comprehensive assess-
ments of the Gangotri glacier in recent times (2004–2011). The methodology entails the
utilization of interferometric SAR (InSAR) coherence and sub-pixel offset tracking. While
complementing most previous studies, the result presented here establishes the effective-
ness of the techniques implemented to produce robust estimates of areal changes and glacier
surface velocity in near real time. But, perhaps most importantly, this is one of the few stud-
ies which has shown the melting trend of Gangotri glacier over a considerably continuous
period during recent times (2004–2011).

Study area
The Gangotri glacier is a valley-type glacier and one of the largest Himalayan glaciers
located in Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand, India (Figure 1). Extending between the lat-
itudes 30◦ 43′ 22′′ N–30◦ 55′ 49′′ N and longitudes 79◦ 4′ 41′′ E–79◦ 16′ 34′′ E, Gangotri
is the only major Himalayan glacier that ﬂows towards the northwest. It spans a length
of 30.2 km, its width varies between 0.20 and 2.35 km, and it thereby covers an area of
about 86.32 km2. While the average thickness of the Gangotri glacier is ∼200 m, its sur-
face elevation varies from 4000 to 7000 m above mean sea level (Jain 2008). Gangotri has
three main tributaries, namely the Raktvarna, the Chaturangi, and the Kirti, with lengths

18 small tributary glaciers of Gangotri and its tributaries. Gangotri and other glaciers in
this region are mostly fed by the summer monsoon and partly by winter snow. Western
disturbances cause heavy snowfall from December to March over this region (Thayyen and
Gergan 2010). Generally, seasonal melting starts in the month of May and continues till
October (Dobhal, Gergan, and Thayyen 2008).

Data and methods
3.1.
Coherence detection for glacier retreat
InSAR provides avenues to study glaciers in terms of snout and glacial lake monitoring, as
well as ground displacement and topographic variations, using interferograms (Luckman,
Quincey, and Bevan 2007; Kumar et al. 2008; Capps et al. 2010). Glacier monitoring using
InSAR is advancing towards new frontiers; in this study, we develop coherence maps using
SAR image pairs to map the location of the snout of the Gangotri glacier. Previously, this
technique has been utilized to delineate glacier extent (Atwood, Meyer, and Arendt 2010)
and to identify debris-covered portions of glaciers in the northwest Himalayas (Frey, Paul,
and Strozzi 2012). In this study, we utilize the coherency attribute between two SAR images
for snout monitoring. We estimate coherence of interferograms made from two SAR acqui-
sitions with the spatial correlation of the InSAR phase over small areas of pixels (Fielding
et al. 2005). This phase correlation is related to the relative displacement of the scatter-
ing objects within each pixel and large surface motion during the time between two SAR
acquisitions. While higher values of coherence are associated with small motion and disrup-
tion of the surface, lower values are representative of considerable displacement or surface
changes over a speciﬁed time period. Practically, it can help in understanding the stabil-
ity of the terrain imaged. Ice, which is constantly melting and accumulating in addition
to ﬂowing laterally, shows very low relative coherence even if the images have a small
temporal baseline. InSAR coherence estimates typically involve a bias of ∼20% in areas

P. Saraswat et al.
of low coherence, so we consider relative values of coherence instead of the absolute val-
ues in order to characterize the stability of the surface. The terminus, where the ground is
exposed as a consequence of glacier retreat, shows better coherence compared to the pix-
els within the glacier (Atwood, Meyer, and Arendt 2010). To delineate a high coherence
zone, which is ice-free ground, we apply a threshold of 0.4 (40%) to InSAR correlation to
select the areas of high coherence from the interferograms. This is based on the assump-
tion that high coherence values are largely due to the presence of ice-free surface near the
glacier snout. The retreat rate is calculated as the distance measured between the mapped
snout in ﬁrst image pair (in this case 2004–2005) and last image pair (2009–2010) along
the central ﬂow line of the glacier. However, coherence of the non-glaciated portions of
land ahead of the terminus may be subsequently affected by ﬂowing melt water from the
glacier. This shortcoming was surpassed by selecting images during early summer (March–
May) and early winter (October–December) with relatively short acquisition intervals over
the Gangotri region. The coherence analysis is based on InSAR, incorporating data sets
acquired by the advanced synthetic aperture radar (ASAR) instrument mounted on the
Envisat satellite (Image Mode; see Table 1). The orbital models for Envisat used in this
study were obtained from ESA Doris orbits (DOR) and processing was performed with
the JPL/Caltech ROI_pac software (Rosen et al. 2004). Digital elevation model (DEM)
data are required to remove and model topographic phase contributions, and to orthorec-
tify the data for intercomparison. Here, we use NASA’s Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission
(SRTM) (Rodriguez, Morris, and Belz 2006) DEM with voids ﬁlled by other sources, avail-
able from Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) Consortium
for Spatial Information (CGIAR-CSI) (http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/). These void-ﬁlled DEMs
(SRTM CGIAR version 3) are particularly effective for the study area since they are
constructed using topographic maps and information from local topography.
However, at times InSAR fails to produce reliable measurements of ice motion for
fast moving glaciers primarily due to temporal decorrelation or loss of coherence, in the
absence of optimal temporal baseline between the image pairs. This aspect is one of the
major limitations associated with this technique. Further, steep slopes, particularly in the
Gangotri region, inhibit an across-track view of the glacier and render SAR data from the
widely available satellites unreliable for glacier velocity measurements. Due to the absence
of Envisat SAR pairs with short time intervals over the study area (minimum possible

repeat time of Envisat was 35 days, but not every orbit had SAR images acquired), tem-
poral decorrelation is a major issue encountered in this study. For the available pairs, the
glacier motion is large enough to cause incoherent InSAR leading to temporal decorrela-
tion. Hence, the absence of good coherence between subsequent SAR image pairs makes it
difﬁcult to measure the Gangotri ice velocity with Envisat InSAR.
3.2.
Velocity measurements using pixel offset tracking
Mapping the glacier surface velocity is crucial for characterizing ice dynamics and quan-
tifying glacier ice mass balance (Bindschadler and Scambos 1991; Joughin et al. 2002;
Rignot and Thomas 2002). In order to overcome the previously mentioned region-speciﬁc
limitation of InSAR in mapping glacier velocity, we took an alternative approach to monitor
glacier velocities utilizing sub-pixel offset tracking on nadir-viewing near infrared (NIR)
imagery from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reﬂection Radiometer
(ASTER). This technique utilizes cross-correlation between two images to estimate sur-
face velocities, details of which are illustrated in Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008).
Pixel offset tracking or sub-pixel correlation is a technique to measure the motion of spa-
tially coherent features through time between two images (Crippen 1992). In glaciology,
these features generally consist of crevasses, undulations, and moraines (Konig, Winther,
and Isaksson 2001). The horizontal displacement thus obtained can be used to generate
velocity maps utilizing the time difference between the images pairs. In this study, the
ENVI- and IDL-based processing software, Co-registration of Optically Sensed Images
and Correlation (COSI-Corr) (Leprince et al. 2007), is used for the said purpose. This
method has been successfully used for measuring glacier velocities such as those in Stearns,
Hamilton, and Reeh (2005), Howat et al. (2008), Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008),
Debella-Gilo and Kääb (2011), Herman, Anderson, and Leprince (2011), and Willis et al.
(2012). Initially, a DEM is used to generate approximate tie points for the master image,
and we used the same SRTM 3-arcsecond DEM with the voids ﬁlled by the CGIAR group
(Version 3) as described above. Tie points are then subjected to an optimization algo-
rithm in order to generate precise ground control points to orthorectify the master image.
Once the master image is orthorectiﬁed, ensuing slave images are orthorectiﬁed using
the same master image. After successful orthorectiﬁcation and co-registration of image
pairs, a correlation algorithm is then applied by moving the correlation windows across
the prepared images on a regular grid. Distinctive features are tracked between image
pairs and their displacement is calculated to produce displacement maps and their cor-
responding signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) maps. Note that the methodology implemented
here is exactly the same as that presented in Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008)
and is most appropriate for additional details on the methodology and functionality of
COSI-Corr.
In order to overcome the limitation of producing high quality velocity estimates from
InSAR, a sub-pixel correlation or offset tracking technique is employed on ASTER L1A
satellite imagery acquired for the region. Table 2 enlists the details of the ASTER L1A data
set analysed in this study. For better results, maximum care is taken to obtain images with
less snowfall and cloud cover, especially over the Gangotri glacier. In order to analyse the
motion over the entire length of the glacier, we acquired ASTER L1A data for two frames
covering the lower and upper reaches of the Gangotri glacier. Both frames were acquired on
the same date and with the same acquisition parameters but processed separately. Another
associated advantage of ASTER imagery over SAR imagery for such difﬁcult terrain is the

availability of the 3N (NIR) band with nadir-viewing geometry and 15 m spatial resolution,
thus minimizing topography-induced errors in the velocity estimates. The images used in
this study are mostly acquired during the month of October, which is the end of the melting
season.
3.3.
Uncertainty analysis
A number of factors contribute to uncertainties in the coherence-based estimates of glacier
retreat rate, including DEM, orbital, and baseline errors. Errors in velocity estimates
obtained using pixel offset tracking can again be attributed primarily to DEM errors, which
are transferred in the form of orthorectiﬁcation errors to the orthorectiﬁed master image.
The SRTM 3-arcsecond DEM that we used has voids ﬁlled by the CGIAR group (Version
3), so the DEM quality is variable. The voids in SRTM version 2 are extensive in the steep
slopes of the Himalayas. We chose ASTER pairs with the same look angle to minimize the
effects of DEM errors since both images have the same viewing geometry. Kääb (2002)
discussed these anomalies as a ground position error, which is about 3 m for moderately
inclined terrains.
Additionally, uncertainties from resampling and image cross-correlation processes are
generally much smaller than the pixel size of 15 m; hence, matches with uncertainties
greater than one pixel are usually discarded during the processing (Scherler, Leprince, and
Strecker 2008). The cumulative error in velocity estimates is less than 5 m year−1 for the
data sets used in this study. This error is estimated by computing surface velocity for loca-
tions where stable ground is exposed typically near the snout to keep other inﬂuencing
factors such as slope and surface conditions as close to the glacier as possible. Since surface
velocity should be ideally zero in these locations, any value other than zero is approximated
as the error. In order to quantify the error, we concentrated on velocities estimated for an
area in front of the snout (Figure 4(a) (Box 1)), which is observed to be ice-free in all of
the images used in this study. Analysis showed that velocities estimated in this study suffer

8659
from a possible bias (mean) of about 4.2 m year−1 and an error (standard deviation) of
about 2.3 m year−1. The high precision in the observed estimates can be attributed to sev-
eral factors such as (1) low cloud cover in the ASTER images, (2) the scenes are obtained
for the same time period (late summer and fall), which helped to eliminate errors related to
snowfall and changes in solar illumination, and (3) the time span between paired ASTER
images are mostly kept at nearly 1 year, which provides a resolvable time window to derive
glacier surface velocities.

Results
4.1.
Glacier recession from 2004–2010
Shown in Figures 2(a) and (b) are the InSAR coherence maps of the Gangotri glacier region
obtained from image pairs with the shortest possible acquisition intervals in order to locate
the snout of the glacier with improved accuracy. The detail of interferometric pairs chosen
to study short and long-term variations of the Gangotri glacier is shown in Table 1. For the
reasons stated above we present results from coherence mapping for Pair 1 (Figure 2(a)) and
Pair 6 (Figure 2(b)). Thus, it can be observed in Figures 2(a) and (b) that by stretching the
values in the coherence maps, the majority of the region registered low coherence, caused
mainly due to accumulation and ablation of snow and ice and also due to steep slopes.
However, regions near the northern ﬂank of the glacier show high coherence (>40%),
which is attributed to the fact that the snout of the glacier has retreated, exposing boulders
and moraines. Hence, these are the areas which show more relative stability over a consid-
erable period of time (typically a few months). Areas further down the valley are likewise
seasonally snow-free but have considerable vegetation (as evident in ASTER scenes, not
shown), which produces low coherence in the image. Thus, high coherence occurs only in
those areas recently exposed by glacial retreat and not yet covered by signiﬁcant vegetation
growth, i.e. only near the glacier snout.
See Table 3 for the snout positions obtained during the period of Pair 1 (2004–2005),
Pair 5, and Pair 6 (2009–2010). These results correlate very well with the snout posi-
tions reported in a previous study, using ground-based surveys (Kumar et al. 2008). The
colour code used in Figure 2(a) and (b) shows two dominant shades, blue representing low
coherence, which is quite apparent over this region since continuous snowfall and melting,
renders most of the region incoherent. The assumption made here is that the newly exposed
surface material adjacent to the snout of the glacier, deposited by continuous recession
of the terminus, should show coherence values well above 40% and is represented by red
zones near the northern ﬂank of the glacier in Figure 2(a) and (b). The average recession
rate of the Gangotri glacier for the period 2004–2010, based on the distance between the
two snout positions (along the central ﬂow line of the glacier), obtained from the coherence
maps (Table 3), is estimated to be 21.3 ± 3 m year−1.
The recession trend is indirectly linked to the glacier mass balance, which is the net
accumulation and ablation within a year measured as the difference between the amount
of snow accumulated in winter and ice removed by melting in summer. The coherence
maps computed from each of the pairs provide insight into the extent of ice-free surface
observed during the respective time periods. Hence, stacking each of these coherence maps
will highlight the area over which terminus retreat has occurred over the entire period of
2004–2010, yielding a holistic view of the ice-free area cleared by ice over the region cov-
ered by the Gangotri glacier and its tributaries. Figure 3 shows the colour-coded coherence
map obtained by stacking the coherence images from Pairs 1, 5, and 6. This represents

Glacier velocity measurements from 2005–2011
In this study, sub-pixel offset tracking analysis is performed on ASTER pairs, acquired
around the month of October during 2005–2006, 2009–2010, and 2010–2011, that covered
the entire Gangotri glacier in two frames. This enables a recent and periodic assessment of
Gangotri glacier dynamics. Figure 4 represents a cumulative analysis plot of the Gangotri
glacier motion. A Euclidean norm of the displacement measured in the north–south and
east–west direction for Pair 2 and Pair 4 (2009–2010), after mosaicking, is shown in

pairs (indicated by bright red colour), with a maximum value of 40 ± 2.3 m year−1 in the
lower glacier (Pair 1) and 70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1 in the upper glacier (Pair 4). Considering
the time difference between the two concerned pairs, the velocity of the Gangotri glacier,
during this period, is estimated to be a maximum of 70.2 m year−1 near the head of the
glacier and less than 30 ± 2.3 m year−1 near the snout of the glacier. It is also evident from
Figure 4(a) that the Gangotri glacier recorded higher motion than the surrounding region of
steep mountain slopes, which had near zero net motion. A clear indication of glacier move-
ment is also apparent from the deﬁnite pattern of motion illustrated in the vector ﬁeld plot
shown in Figure 4(b). Streamlines of velocity vectors (shown in Figure 4(b)) clearly demar-
cate the glacier extent and illustrate the magnitude and direction of glacier ice motion.
In order to demonstrate, in greater detail, velocity variations within the Gangotri
glacier during the span of 2005–2011, glacier surface velocity along the central ﬂow line
of Gangotri (Figure 4(b)) is analysed for each of the images pairs (Table 2). Shown in
Figures 4(c) and (d) is the velocity versus distance curve drawn along the proﬁle line (Line
AB for Pairs 1, 2, and 3 and CD for Pair 4 and 5 in Figure 4(b)). As observed from the pro-
ﬁle plot for the lower reaches of Gangotri (Figure 4(c)), surface velocity variation is almost
similar for all the three pairs. However, the annual ﬂow rate for Pair 1 (2005–2006) is
comparatively lower than that of Pair 2 (2009–2010) and Pair 3 (2010–2011), particu-
larly near the snout and in the lower reaches of the glacier. In general, surface velocity
is larger at higher reaches of the glacier as compared to those near the lower reaches and
is likely dependent on variations in the glacier slope, width, and thickness. This pattern
is also evident from the proﬁle plot for higher reaches of the glacier (Figure 4(d) (also
see supplementary Figure S1 at http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2013.845923), where
the glacier mass velocity is considerably higher near the head of the Gangotri glacier, for
both the image pairs. While surface velocity near the snout, for all the time periods, varied
between 24.8 ± 2.3 to 28.9 ± 2.3 m year−1, velocities away from the snout varied between
a minimum of 13.9 ± 2.3 m year−1 to a maximum of 70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1 (in the upper
reaches of the glacier). The average velocity for the image pairs, 1, 2, and 3, are 28.1 ± 2.3,
27.9 ± 2.3, and 28.2 ± 2.3 m year−1, respectively, which is considerably lower than the
average velocities for Pair 4 and Pair 5, which are 45.7 ± 2.3 and 50.4 ± 2.3 m year−1,
respectively.

Discussion
Glacier surface velocity and retreat rate are two very important parameters that are used to
characterize glacier dynamics. This study has produced reliable estimates of both of these
parameters. The methodology involved the utilization of coherence mapping and image
stacking to locate and monitor snout movement as well as quantify the zone of melting
over a considerable time span. The observed snout positions between 2004 and 2010 are
commensurate with those observed in earlier studies. Gangotri glacier retreat rate observed
in this study is comparable to rates of 23 m year−1 (for 1985–2001) (Hasnain, Ahmad,
and Kumar 2004; Cruz et al. 2007), 17.15 m year−1 (1971–2004) (Raina 2009), 23.2 m
year−1 (for 1968–2001) (Bhambri, Bolch, and Chaujar 2011a, 2011b), and 19.9 m year−1
(for 1965–2006) (Bhambri, Bolch, and Chaujar 2012). The most recent estimate of glacier
retreat using the differential global positioning system (DGPS) and satellite imagery was
obtained to be 17.59 m year−1 for the period of 1976–2009 (Kumar, Areendran, and Rao
2009). Table 4 summarizes some of the most recently published retreat rates of the Gangotri
glacier. The retreat rate measured in this study corroborates well with most of the long-term

measurements, estimated over the past 70 years, which also establishes the efﬁcacy of the
methodology presented here. And perhaps most importantly, the results presented here indi-
cate that the most recent retreat rate of the Gangotri glacier conﬁrms a continuous retreat
of the glacier with a consistent rate taking into consideration multidecadal measurements.
The current study also addresses the phenomenon of temporal decorrelation and associ-
ated limitations of InSAR with longer time intervals for surface velocity measurements
and DEM generation for this particular region of the Eastern Himalayas. Sub-pixel offset
tracking, utilizing ASTER data, enabled high-resolution measurements of surface ice-mass
velocity, which is particularly relevant in difﬁcult mountainous terrains such as that of the
present study area (e.g. Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker 2008). A comprehensive analysis
of surface velocity of the Gangotri glacier is performed for the entire length, from snout to
the head, of the glacier. In general, the observed surface velocity variations of the Gangotri
glacier are comparatively similar for the entire range of image pairs (between 2005 and
2011) acquired for this study. However, the magnitude of glacier motion is typically low
for the period 2005–2006, which was also reported in Raina (2009). While the majority of
the incongruence amongst the spatial distribution of surface velocity is noted in the upper
reaches of the glacier, velocities near the snout are almost similar over all time periods. The
annual variations are high, which indicates fast motion of the Gangotri glacier, especially
during the period 2009–2011. These estimates are considerably higher than the short-term
estimates made by Kumar, Venkataraman, and Hogda (2011), Kumar et al. (2011), and
yearly estimates by Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008). Such high surface velocities
may indicate that ice motion in this region is dominated by basal sliding in the ablation
zone of this relatively steep glacier. The velocities estimated here are based on cumula-
tive surface displacement experienced by the glacier over a period of 1 year. Hence, these
velocity estimates do not reﬂect on its seasonal variation. The surface velocity variations
are most comparable for Pairs 2 and 3. However, on average, surface velocity is observed
to be lower during 2005–2006 compared to 2010–2011. These year-to-year variations can
be attributed to factors such as variations in meteorological conditions (Singh et al. 2006)
and the amount of basal sliding (Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker 2008) over the years.
However, yearly differences in the amount of basal sliding due to the variation in melt
water ﬂux can be a contributory factor.
The current study has the potential to provide an integrated assessment of glacier ﬂow
dynamics, to complement previous and future studies in the area and to provide a key
methodology to delineate glacial lake formation (Quincey et al. 2007; Bolch et al. 2011),
which is of major concern in the Himalayan glaciers.

Conclusions
This study provides comprehensive characterization of the dynamics of the Gangotri glacier
in terms of retreat rate and surface velocity estimates over a continuous period from 2004 to
2010. We employed SAR interferometry to quantify the snout retreat of the Gangotri glacier
in the Himalayas, exploring its capabilities for an integrated assessment of the glacier.
Results showed that the Gangotri glacier, which is one of the largest Himalayan glaciers,
retreated about 119 m over a period of 6 years (2004–2010), at an average rate of 21.3 ± 3 m
year−1. In the context of previous studies, the rate has been almost the same for the last
couple of decades. The results also demonstrated that retreat rate of the terminus was not
uniform over the 6-year period. Further, stacking coherence images from different SAR
pairs delineated the area cleared by ice from 2004 to 2010, facilitating a broader idea about
melting of Gangotri and its tributary glaciers. Results from the sub-pixel offset tracking of
ASTER images revealed signiﬁcant motion along the length of the glacier and its tributaries
compared to the surrounding region, meanwhile establishing a better picture of ﬂow char-
acteristics of the Gangotri glacier. High velocities were observed at the upper reaches of the
glacier while comparatively less movement was observed near the snout. Speciﬁcally, while
the average glacier surface velocity was estimated to be about 36.1 ± 2.3 m year−1, over the
period 2005–2011, the maximum and minimum velocities ranged between 13.9 ± 2.3 and
70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1. Overall, variation of surface velocity of ice mass over the entire length
of the Gangotri glacier was approximately similar for all of the image pairs studied for the
period 2005–2011. While most previous studies suggest a decrease in retreat rate based on
observations made over short time period (e.g. Kumar et al. 2008), our study, which is based
on almost continuous measurements over a period of 6 years, suggests that the glacier is
melting at a constant rate, which is in accordance with long-term estimates measured since
1965. Such observations are useful in assessing the glacier’s response to climate change
and provide an avenue to understand glacier dynamics and its relation to glacier surface
morphology.

Glacier mass variations have a direct impact on some of the key components of the
global water cycle, including sea level rise and freshwater availability. Apart from being
one of the largest Himalayan glaciers, Gangotri is one of the sources of water for the
Ganges river, which has a considerable inﬂuence on the socioeconomic structure of a
largely over-populated catchment area accounting for ∼26% of India’s landmass. In this
study, we present the most recent assessment of the Gangotri glacier dynamics, combin-
ing the use of interferometric techniques on synthetic aperture radar data and sub-pixel
offset tracking on Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reﬂection Radiometer
(ASTER) satellite imagery. Results show that on average, the Gangotri glacier snout
has receded at a rate of 21.3 ± 3 m year−1 over a period of 6 years (2004–2010).
While glacier surface velocity near the snout is estimated to be between 24.8 ± 2.3 and
28.9 ± 2.3 m year−1, interior portions of the glacier recorded velocities in the range of
13.9 ± 2.3 to 70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1. Further, the average glacier surface velocity in the
northern (lower) portions (28.1 ± 2.3 m year−1) is observed to be signiﬁcantly lower
than in the southern (higher) portions (48.1 ± 2.3 m year−1) of the Gangotri glacier.
These values are calculated with an uncertainty of less than 5 m year−1. Results also
highlight a consistent retreat and non-uniform dynamics of the Gangotri glacier.

Introduction
The impact of climate change on glaciers of the world has been a topic of active concern
in recent times (Syed et al. 2007; Bagla 2009; Cogley et al. 2010). While glacial melt is a
major source of freshwater that contributes to global mean sea level rise (Meier et al. 2007;
Jacob et al. 2012), decreasing glacial mass has an impact on the freshwater resources of
some of the largest river basins in the world, including that of the Ganges (e.g. Kumar,
Singh, and Sharma 2005; Mall et al. 2006; Immerzeel, van Beek, and Bierkens 2010;
Kaser, Grosshauser, and Marzeion 2010). Fluctuations in the recession rate of glaciers dur-
ing recent years have initiated widespread discussions, especially in the context of global
warming and its effects (Dyurgerov and Meier 2005). Similar ice mass changes have also
been reported in the Garhwal region of the Himalayas (Kulkarni et al. 2005; Bhambri,
Bolch, and Chaujar 2011a, 2011b; Kulkarni et al. 2011; Bolch et al. 2012). However, the

status of the Gangotri glacier warrants further investigation, particularly in the context of
climate change resulting in continuous retreat, negative mass balance, and early melting of
seasonal snow cover (Negi et al. 2012).
Glaciers cover about 40,800 km2 of the Himalayan and Karakoram mountain region,
and are one of the main sources of water to some of the largest rivers in the world, including
the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Indus (Kulkarni et al. 2011; Bajracharya and Shrestha 2011;
Bolch et al. 2012). Approximately 10% of the summer discharge of the Ganges is attributed
to melt waters from glaciers (Barnett, Adam, and Letternmaier 2005; Jain, Agarwal, and
Singh 2007; Immerzeel, van Beek, and Bierkens 2010; Bolch et al. 2012). Rapid depletion
of glaciers has had adverse effects on the ﬂow regime of major Himalayan rivers, and can
even lead to catastrophic events such as glacial lake outbursts (Govindha 2010; Shrestha,
Eriksson, and Mool 2010; Ashraf, Naz, and Roohi 2012) and consequent ﬂooding in the
upper reaches of these rivers, affecting the lives of millions of people residing in the Indo-
Gangetic plains (Richardson and Reynolds 2000; Bolch et al. 2012).
In spite of their hydrologic, climatic, and socioeconomic signiﬁcance, opportunities for
precise and continuous monitoring of the Himalayan glaciers are limited by logistical and
terrain-induced difﬁculties. Observations of Earth’s surface using satellite data have proven
to be very useful in such monitoring; recent developments in high-resolution image acqui-
sition have facilitated more precise monitoring of glacier movement (Luckman, Quincey,
and Bevan 2007; Kumar, Venkataraman, and Hogda 2011; Kumar et al. 2011). Further,
satellite data enables a gross analysis of glacier mass budgets, overcoming some of the
problems of accessibility and sustainability of long-term measurements, that can later be
veriﬁed with ground-based surveys (Kumar et al. 2008). The potential of remote sensing
for glacier mass balance and velocity mapping has been demonstrated with optical (e.g.
Kääb 2005; Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker 2008), synthetic aperture radar (SAR) (e.g.
Luckman, Quincey, and Bevan 2007), and thermal infrared sensors (e.g. Nakawo, Yabuki,
and Sakai 1999), and elevation models (Bolch, Pieczonka, and Benn 2011), among others.
Developments in deriving ﬂow rates and monitoring Himalayan glacier retreat using optical
images have been made by Kääb (2005). However, this approach is sometimes limited by
weather, clouds, and shadows in areas of high relief.
In a novel approach, the current study presents one of the most comprehensive assess-
ments of the Gangotri glacier in recent times (2004–2011). The methodology entails the
utilization of interferometric SAR (InSAR) coherence and sub-pixel offset tracking. While
complementing most previous studies, the result presented here establishes the effective-
ness of the techniques implemented to produce robust estimates of areal changes and glacier
surface velocity in near real time. But, perhaps most importantly, this is one of the few stud-
ies which has shown the melting trend of Gangotri glacier over a considerably continuous
period during recent times (2004–2011).

Study area
The Gangotri glacier is a valley-type glacier and one of the largest Himalayan glaciers
located in Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand, India (Figure 1). Extending between the lat-
itudes 30◦ 43′ 22′′ N–30◦ 55′ 49′′ N and longitudes 79◦ 4′ 41′′ E–79◦ 16′ 34′′ E, Gangotri
is the only major Himalayan glacier that ﬂows towards the northwest. It spans a length
of 30.2 km, its width varies between 0.20 and 2.35 km, and it thereby covers an area of
about 86.32 km2. While the average thickness of the Gangotri glacier is ∼200 m, its sur-
face elevation varies from 4000 to 7000 m above mean sea level (Jain 2008). Gangotri has
three main tributaries, namely the Raktvarna, the Chaturangi, and the Kirti, with lengths

of 15.90, 22.45, and 11.05 km, respectively (Figure 1). Additionally, there are more than
18 small tributary glaciers of Gangotri and its tributaries. Gangotri and other glaciers in
this region are mostly fed by the summer monsoon and partly by winter snow. Western
disturbances cause heavy snowfall from December to March over this region (Thayyen and
Gergan 2010). Generally, seasonal melting starts in the month of May and continues till
October (Dobhal, Gergan, and Thayyen 2008).

Data and methods
3.1.
Coherence detection for glacier retreat
InSAR provides avenues to study glaciers in terms of snout and glacial lake monitoring, as
well as ground displacement and topographic variations, using interferograms (Luckman,
Quincey, and Bevan 2007; Kumar et al. 2008; Capps et al. 2010). Glacier monitoring using
InSAR is advancing towards new frontiers; in this study, we develop coherence maps using
SAR image pairs to map the location of the snout of the Gangotri glacier. Previously, this
technique has been utilized to delineate glacier extent (Atwood, Meyer, and Arendt 2010)
and to identify debris-covered portions of glaciers in the northwest Himalayas (Frey, Paul,
and Strozzi 2012). In this study, we utilize the coherency attribute between two SAR images
for snout monitoring. We estimate coherence of interferograms made from two SAR acqui-
sitions with the spatial correlation of the InSAR phase over small areas of pixels (Fielding
et al. 2005). This phase correlation is related to the relative displacement of the scatter-
ing objects within each pixel and large surface motion during the time between two SAR
acquisitions. While higher values of coherence are associated with small motion and disrup-
tion of the surface, lower values are representative of considerable displacement or surface
changes over a speciﬁed time period. Practically, it can help in understanding the stabil-
ity of the terrain imaged. Ice, which is constantly melting and accumulating in addition
to ﬂowing laterally, shows very low relative coherence even if the images have a small
temporal baseline. InSAR coherence estimates typically involve a bias of ∼20% in areas

P. Saraswat et al.
of low coherence, so we consider relative values of coherence instead of the absolute val-
ues in order to characterize the stability of the surface. The terminus, where the ground is
exposed as a consequence of glacier retreat, shows better coherence compared to the pix-
els within the glacier (Atwood, Meyer, and Arendt 2010). To delineate a high coherence
zone, which is ice-free ground, we apply a threshold of 0.4 (40%) to InSAR correlation to
select the areas of high coherence from the interferograms. This is based on the assump-
tion that high coherence values are largely due to the presence of ice-free surface near the
glacier snout. The retreat rate is calculated as the distance measured between the mapped
snout in ﬁrst image pair (in this case 2004–2005) and last image pair (2009–2010) along
the central ﬂow line of the glacier. However, coherence of the non-glaciated portions of
land ahead of the terminus may be subsequently affected by ﬂowing melt water from the
glacier. This shortcoming was surpassed by selecting images during early summer (March–
May) and early winter (October–December) with relatively short acquisition intervals over
the Gangotri region. The coherence analysis is based on InSAR, incorporating data sets
acquired by the advanced synthetic aperture radar (ASAR) instrument mounted on the
Envisat satellite (Image Mode; see Table 1). The orbital models for Envisat used in this
study were obtained from ESA Doris orbits (DOR) and processing was performed with
the JPL/Caltech ROI_pac software (Rosen et al. 2004). Digital elevation model (DEM)
data are required to remove and model topographic phase contributions, and to orthorec-
tify the data for intercomparison. Here, we use NASA’s Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission
(SRTM) (Rodriguez, Morris, and Belz 2006) DEM with voids ﬁlled by other sources, avail-
able from Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) Consortium
for Spatial Information (CGIAR-CSI) (http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/). These void-ﬁlled DEMs
(SRTM CGIAR version 3) are particularly effective for the study area since they are
constructed using topographic maps and information from local topography.
However, at times InSAR fails to produce reliable measurements of ice motion for
fast moving glaciers primarily due to temporal decorrelation or loss of coherence, in the
absence of optimal temporal baseline between the image pairs. This aspect is one of the
major limitations associated with this technique. Further, steep slopes, particularly in the
Gangotri region, inhibit an across-track view of the glacier and render SAR data from the
widely available satellites unreliable for glacier velocity measurements. Due to the absence
of Envisat SAR pairs with short time intervals over the study area (minimum possible

repeat time of Envisat was 35 days, but not every orbit had SAR images acquired), tem-
poral decorrelation is a major issue encountered in this study. For the available pairs, the
glacier motion is large enough to cause incoherent InSAR leading to temporal decorrela-
tion. Hence, the absence of good coherence between subsequent SAR image pairs makes it
difﬁcult to measure the Gangotri ice velocity with Envisat InSAR.
3.2.
Velocity measurements using pixel offset tracking
Mapping the glacier surface velocity is crucial for characterizing ice dynamics and quan-
tifying glacier ice mass balance (Bindschadler and Scambos 1991; Joughin et al. 2002;
Rignot and Thomas 2002). In order to overcome the previously mentioned region-speciﬁc
limitation of InSAR in mapping glacier velocity, we took an alternative approach to monitor
glacier velocities utilizing sub-pixel offset tracking on nadir-viewing near infrared (NIR)
imagery from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reﬂection Radiometer
(ASTER). This technique utilizes cross-correlation between two images to estimate sur-
face velocities, details of which are illustrated in Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008).
Pixel offset tracking or sub-pixel correlation is a technique to measure the motion of spa-
tially coherent features through time between two images (Crippen 1992). In glaciology,
these features generally consist of crevasses, undulations, and moraines (Konig, Winther,
and Isaksson 2001). The horizontal displacement thus obtained can be used to generate
velocity maps utilizing the time difference between the images pairs. In this study, the
ENVI- and IDL-based processing software, Co-registration of Optically Sensed Images
and Correlation (COSI-Corr) (Leprince et al. 2007), is used for the said purpose. This
method has been successfully used for measuring glacier velocities such as those in Stearns,
Hamilton, and Reeh (2005), Howat et al. (2008), Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008),
Debella-Gilo and Kääb (2011), Herman, Anderson, and Leprince (2011), and Willis et al.
(2012). Initially, a DEM is used to generate approximate tie points for the master image,
and we used the same SRTM 3-arcsecond DEM with the voids ﬁlled by the CGIAR group
(Version 3) as described above. Tie points are then subjected to an optimization algo-
rithm in order to generate precise ground control points to orthorectify the master image.
Once the master image is orthorectiﬁed, ensuing slave images are orthorectiﬁed using
the same master image. After successful orthorectiﬁcation and co-registration of image
pairs, a correlation algorithm is then applied by moving the correlation windows across
the prepared images on a regular grid. Distinctive features are tracked between image
pairs and their displacement is calculated to produce displacement maps and their cor-
responding signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) maps. Note that the methodology implemented
here is exactly the same as that presented in Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008)
and is most appropriate for additional details on the methodology and functionality of
COSI-Corr.
In order to overcome the limitation of producing high quality velocity estimates from
InSAR, a sub-pixel correlation or offset tracking technique is employed on ASTER L1A
satellite imagery acquired for the region. Table 2 enlists the details of the ASTER L1A data
set analysed in this study. For better results, maximum care is taken to obtain images with
less snowfall and cloud cover, especially over the Gangotri glacier. In order to analyse the
motion over the entire length of the glacier, we acquired ASTER L1A data for two frames
covering the lower and upper reaches of the Gangotri glacier. Both frames were acquired on
the same date and with the same acquisition parameters but processed separately. Another
associated advantage of ASTER imagery over SAR imagery for such difﬁcult terrain is the

availability of the 3N (NIR) band with nadir-viewing geometry and 15 m spatial resolution,
thus minimizing topography-induced errors in the velocity estimates. The images used in
this study are mostly acquired during the month of October, which is the end of the melting
season.
3.3.
Uncertainty analysis
A number of factors contribute to uncertainties in the coherence-based estimates of glacier
retreat rate, including DEM, orbital, and baseline errors. Errors in velocity estimates
obtained using pixel offset tracking can again be attributed primarily to DEM errors, which
are transferred in the form of orthorectiﬁcation errors to the orthorectiﬁed master image.
The SRTM 3-arcsecond DEM that we used has voids ﬁlled by the CGIAR group (Version
3), so the DEM quality is variable. The voids in SRTM version 2 are extensive in the steep
slopes of the Himalayas. We chose ASTER pairs with the same look angle to minimize the
effects of DEM errors since both images have the same viewing geometry. Kääb (2002)
discussed these anomalies as a ground position error, which is about 3 m for moderately
inclined terrains.
Additionally, uncertainties from resampling and image cross-correlation processes are
generally much smaller than the pixel size of 15 m; hence, matches with uncertainties
greater than one pixel are usually discarded during the processing (Scherler, Leprince, and
Strecker 2008). The cumulative error in velocity estimates is less than 5 m year−1 for the
data sets used in this study. This error is estimated by computing surface velocity for loca-
tions where stable ground is exposed typically near the snout to keep other inﬂuencing
factors such as slope and surface conditions as close to the glacier as possible. Since surface
velocity should be ideally zero in these locations, any value other than zero is approximated
as the error. In order to quantify the error, we concentrated on velocities estimated for an
area in front of the snout (Figure 4(a) (Box 1)), which is observed to be ice-free in all of
the images used in this study. Analysis showed that velocities estimated in this study suffer

from a possible bias (mean) of about 4.2 m year−1 and an error (standard deviation) of
about 2.3 m year−1. The high precision in the observed estimates can be attributed to sev-
eral factors such as (1) low cloud cover in the ASTER images, (2) the scenes are obtained
for the same time period (late summer and fall), which helped to eliminate errors related to
snowfall and changes in solar illumination, and (3) the time span between paired ASTER
images are mostly kept at nearly 1 year, which provides a resolvable time window to derive
glacier surface velocities.

Results
4.1.
Glacier recession from 2004–2010
Shown in Figures 2(a) and (b) are the InSAR coherence maps of the Gangotri glacier region
obtained from image pairs with the shortest possible acquisition intervals in order to locate
the snout of the glacier with improved accuracy. The detail of interferometric pairs chosen
to study short and long-term variations of the Gangotri glacier is shown in Table 1. For the
reasons stated above we present results from coherence mapping for Pair 1 (Figure 2(a)) and
Pair 6 (Figure 2(b)). Thus, it can be observed in Figures 2(a) and (b) that by stretching the
values in the coherence maps, the majority of the region registered low coherence, caused
mainly due to accumulation and ablation of snow and ice and also due to steep slopes.
However, regions near the northern ﬂank of the glacier show high coherence (>40%),
which is attributed to the fact that the snout of the glacier has retreated, exposing boulders
and moraines. Hence, these are the areas which show more relative stability over a consid-
erable period of time (typically a few months). Areas further down the valley are likewise
seasonally snow-free but have considerable vegetation (as evident in ASTER scenes, not
shown), which produces low coherence in the image. Thus, high coherence occurs only in
those areas recently exposed by glacial retreat and not yet covered by signiﬁcant vegetation
growth, i.e. only near the glacier snout.
See Table 3 for the snout positions obtained during the period of Pair 1 (2004–2005),
Pair 5, and Pair 6 (2009–2010). These results correlate very well with the snout posi-
tions reported in a previous study, using ground-based surveys (Kumar et al. 2008). The
colour code used in Figure 2(a) and (b) shows two dominant shades, blue representing low
coherence, which is quite apparent over this region since continuous snowfall and melting,
renders most of the region incoherent. The assumption made here is that the newly exposed
surface material adjacent to the snout of the glacier, deposited by continuous recession
of the terminus, should show coherence values well above 40% and is represented by red
zones near the northern ﬂank of the glacier in Figure 2(a) and (b). The average recession
rate of the Gangotri glacier for the period 2004–2010, based on the distance between the
two snout positions (along the central ﬂow line of the glacier), obtained from the coherence
maps (Table 3), is estimated to be 21.3 ± 3 m year−1.
The recession trend is indirectly linked to the glacier mass balance, which is the net
accumulation and ablation within a year measured as the difference between the amount
of snow accumulated in winter and ice removed by melting in summer. The coherence
maps computed from each of the pairs provide insight into the extent of ice-free surface
observed during the respective time periods. Hence, stacking each of these coherence maps
will highlight the area over which terminus retreat has occurred over the entire period of
2004–2010, yielding a holistic view of the ice-free area cleared by ice over the region cov-
ered by the Gangotri glacier and its tributaries. Figure 3 shows the colour-coded coherence
map obtained by stacking the coherence images from Pairs 1, 5, and 6. This represents

Glacier velocity measurements from 2005–2011
In this study, sub-pixel offset tracking analysis is performed on ASTER pairs, acquired
around the month of October during 2005–2006, 2009–2010, and 2010–2011, that covered
the entire Gangotri glacier in two frames. This enables a recent and periodic assessment of
Gangotri glacier dynamics. Figure 4 represents a cumulative analysis plot of the Gangotri
glacier motion. A Euclidean norm of the displacement measured in the north–south and
east–west direction for Pair 2 and Pair 4 (2009–2010), after mosaicking, is shown in

pairs (indicated by bright red colour), with a maximum value of 40 ± 2.3 m year−1 in the
lower glacier (Pair 1) and 70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1 in the upper glacier (Pair 4). Considering
the time difference between the two concerned pairs, the velocity of the Gangotri glacier,
during this period, is estimated to be a maximum of 70.2 m year−1 near the head of the
glacier and less than 30 ± 2.3 m year−1 near the snout of the glacier. It is also evident from
Figure 4(a) that the Gangotri glacier recorded higher motion than the surrounding region of
steep mountain slopes, which had near zero net motion. A clear indication of glacier move-
ment is also apparent from the deﬁnite pattern of motion illustrated in the vector ﬁeld plot
shown in Figure 4(b). Streamlines of velocity vectors (shown in Figure 4(b)) clearly demar-
cate the glacier extent and illustrate the magnitude and direction of glacier ice motion.
In order to demonstrate, in greater detail, velocity variations within the Gangotri
glacier during the span of 2005–2011, glacier surface velocity along the central ﬂow line
of Gangotri (Figure 4(b)) is analysed for each of the images pairs (Table 2). Shown in
Figures 4(c) and (d) is the velocity versus distance curve drawn along the proﬁle line (Line
AB for Pairs 1, 2, and 3 and CD for Pair 4 and 5 in Figure 4(b)). As observed from the pro-
ﬁle plot for the lower reaches of Gangotri (Figure 4(c)), surface velocity variation is almost
similar for all the three pairs. However, the annual ﬂow rate for Pair 1 (2005–2006) is
comparatively lower than that of Pair 2 (2009–2010) and Pair 3 (2010–2011), particu-
larly near the snout and in the lower reaches of the glacier. In general, surface velocity
is larger at higher reaches of the glacier as compared to those near the lower reaches and
is likely dependent on variations in the glacier slope, width, and thickness. This pattern
is also evident from the proﬁle plot for higher reaches of the glacier (Figure 4(d) (also
see supplementary Figure S1 at http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2013.845923), where
the glacier mass velocity is considerably higher near the head of the Gangotri glacier, for
both the image pairs. While surface velocity near the snout, for all the time periods, varied
between 24.8 ± 2.3 to 28.9 ± 2.3 m year−1, velocities away from the snout varied between
a minimum of 13.9 ± 2.3 m year−1 to a maximum of 70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1 (in the upper
reaches of the glacier). The average velocity for the image pairs, 1, 2, and 3, are 28.1 ± 2.3,
27.9 ± 2.3, and 28.2 ± 2.3 m year−1, respectively, which is considerably lower than the
average velocities for Pair 4 and Pair 5, which are 45.7 ± 2.3 and 50.4 ± 2.3 m year−1,
respectively.

Discussion
Glacier surface velocity and retreat rate are two very important parameters that are used to
characterize glacier dynamics. This study has produced reliable estimates of both of these
parameters. The methodology involved the utilization of coherence mapping and image
stacking to locate and monitor snout movement as well as quantify the zone of melting
over a considerable time span. The observed snout positions between 2004 and 2010 are
commensurate with those observed in earlier studies. Gangotri glacier retreat rate observed
in this study is comparable to rates of 23 m year−1 (for 1985–2001) (Hasnain, Ahmad,
and Kumar 2004; Cruz et al. 2007), 17.15 m year−1 (1971–2004) (Raina 2009), 23.2 m
year−1 (for 1968–2001) (Bhambri, Bolch, and Chaujar 2011a, 2011b), and 19.9 m year−1
(for 1965–2006) (Bhambri, Bolch, and Chaujar 2012). The most recent estimate of glacier
retreat using the differential global positioning system (DGPS) and satellite imagery was
obtained to be 17.59 m year−1 for the period of 1976–2009 (Kumar, Areendran, and Rao
2009). Table 4 summarizes some of the most recently published retreat rates of the Gangotri
glacier. The retreat rate measured in this study corroborates well with most of the long-term

measurements, estimated over the past 70 years, which also establishes the efﬁcacy of the
methodology presented here. And perhaps most importantly, the results presented here indi-
cate that the most recent retreat rate of the Gangotri glacier conﬁrms a continuous retreat
of the glacier with a consistent rate taking into consideration multidecadal measurements.
The current study also addresses the phenomenon of temporal decorrelation and associ-
ated limitations of InSAR with longer time intervals for surface velocity measurements
and DEM generation for this particular region of the Eastern Himalayas. Sub-pixel offset
tracking, utilizing ASTER data, enabled high-resolution measurements of surface ice-mass
velocity, which is particularly relevant in difﬁcult mountainous terrains such as that of the
present study area (e.g. Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker 2008). A comprehensive analysis
of surface velocity of the Gangotri glacier is performed for the entire length, from snout to
the head, of the glacier. In general, the observed surface velocity variations of the Gangotri
glacier are comparatively similar for the entire range of image pairs (between 2005 and
2011) acquired for this study. However, the magnitude of glacier motion is typically low
for the period 2005–2006, which was also reported in Raina (2009). While the majority of
the incongruence amongst the spatial distribution of surface velocity is noted in the upper
reaches of the glacier, velocities near the snout are almost similar over all time periods. The
annual variations are high, which indicates fast motion of the Gangotri glacier, especially
during the period 2009–2011. These estimates are considerably higher than the short-term
estimates made by Kumar, Venkataraman, and Hogda (2011), Kumar et al. (2011), and
yearly estimates by Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008). Such high surface velocities
may indicate that ice motion in this region is dominated by basal sliding in the ablation
zone of this relatively steep glacier. The velocities estimated here are based on cumula-
tive surface displacement experienced by the glacier over a period of 1 year. Hence, these
velocity estimates do not reﬂect on its seasonal variation. The surface velocity variations
are most comparable for Pairs 2 and 3. However, on average, surface velocity is observed
to be lower during 2005–2006 compared to 2010–2011. These year-to-year variations can
be attributed to factors such as variations in meteorological conditions (Singh et al. 2006)
and the amount of basal sliding (Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker 2008) over the years.
However, yearly differences in the amount of basal sliding due to the variation in melt
water ﬂux can be a contributory factor.
The current study has the potential to provide an integrated assessment of glacier ﬂow
dynamics, to complement previous and future studies in the area and to provide a key
methodology to delineate glacial lake formation (Quincey et al. 2007; Bolch et al. 2011),
which is of major concern in the Himalayan glaciers.

Conclusions
This study provides comprehensive characterization of the dynamics of the Gangotri glacier
in terms of retreat rate and surface velocity estimates over a continuous period from 2004 to
2010. We employed SAR interferometry to quantify the snout retreat of the Gangotri glacier
in the Himalayas, exploring its capabilities for an integrated assessment of the glacier.
Results showed that the Gangotri glacier, which is one of the largest Himalayan glaciers,
retreated about 119 m over a period of 6 years (2004–2010), at an average rate of 21.3 ± 3 m
year−1. In the context of previous studies, the rate has been almost the same for the last
couple of decades. The results also demonstrated that retreat rate of the terminus was not
uniform over the 6-year period. Further, stacking coherence images from different SAR
pairs delineated the area cleared by ice from 2004 to 2010, facilitating a broader idea about
melting of Gangotri and its tributary glaciers. Results from the sub-pixel offset tracking of
ASTER images revealed signiﬁcant motion along the length of the glacier and its tributaries
compared to the surrounding region, meanwhile establishing a better picture of ﬂow char-
acteristics of the Gangotri glacier. High velocities were observed at the upper reaches of the
glacier while comparatively less movement was observed near the snout. Speciﬁcally, while
the average glacier surface velocity was estimated to be about 36.1 ± 2.3 m year−1, over the
period 2005–2011, the maximum and minimum velocities ranged between 13.9 ± 2.3 and
70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1. Overall, variation of surface velocity of ice mass over the entire length
of the Gangotri glacier was approximately similar for all of the image pairs studied for the
period 2005–2011. While most previous studies suggest a decrease in retreat rate based on
observations made over short time period (e.g. Kumar et al. 2008), our study, which is based
on almost continuous measurements over a period of 6 years, suggests that the glacier is
melting at a constant rate, which is in accordance with long-term estimates measured since
1965. Such observations are useful in assessing the glacier’s response to climate change
and provide an avenue to understand glacier dynamics and its relation to glacier surface
morphology.

(Received 19 October 2012; accepted 2 September 2013)
Glacier mass variations have a direct impact on some of the key components of the
global water cycle, including sea level rise and freshwater availability. Apart from being
one of the largest Himalayan glaciers, Gangotri is one of the sources of water for the
Ganges river, which has a considerable inﬂuence on the socioeconomic structure of a
largely over-populated catchment area accounting for ∼26% of India’s landmass. In this
study, we present the most recent assessment of the Gangotri glacier dynamics, combin-
ing the use of interferometric techniques on synthetic aperture radar data and sub-pixel
offset tracking on Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reﬂection Radiometer
(ASTER) satellite imagery. Results show that on average, the Gangotri glacier snout
has receded at a rate of 21.3 ± 3 m year−1 over a period of 6 years (2004–2010).
While glacier surface velocity near the snout is estimated to be between 24.8 ± 2.3 and
28.9 ± 2.3 m year−1, interior portions of the glacier recorded velocities in the range of
13.9 ± 2.3 to 70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1. Further, the average glacier surface velocity in the
northern (lower) portions (28.1 ± 2.3 m year−1) is observed to be signiﬁcantly lower
than in the southern (higher) portions (48.1 ± 2.3 m year−1) of the Gangotri glacier.
These values are calculated with an uncertainty of less than 5 m year−1. Results also
highlight a consistent retreat and non-uniform dynamics of the Gangotri glacier.

Introduction
The impact of climate change on glaciers of the world has been a topic of active concern
in recent times (Syed et al. 2007; Bagla 2009; Cogley et al. 2010). While glacial melt is a
major source of freshwater that contributes to global mean sea level rise (Meier et al. 2007;
Jacob et al. 2012), decreasing glacial mass has an impact on the freshwater resources of
some of the largest river basins in the world, including that of the Ganges (e.g. Kumar,
Singh, and Sharma 2005; Mall et al. 2006; Immerzeel, van Beek, and Bierkens 2010;
Kaser, Grosshauser, and Marzeion 2010). Fluctuations in the recession rate of glaciers dur-
ing recent years have initiated widespread discussions, especially in the context of global
warming and its effects (Dyurgerov and Meier 2005). Similar ice mass changes have also
been reported in the Garhwal region of the Himalayas (Kulkarni et al. 2005; Bhambri,
Bolch, and Chaujar 2011a, 2011b; Kulkarni et al. 2011; Bolch et al. 2012). However, the

status of the Gangotri glacier warrants further investigation, particularly in the context of
climate change resulting in continuous retreat, negative mass balance, and early melting of
seasonal snow cover (Negi et al. 2012).
Glaciers cover about 40,800 km2 of the Himalayan and Karakoram mountain region,
and are one of the main sources of water to some of the largest rivers in the world, including
the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Indus (Kulkarni et al. 2011; Bajracharya and Shrestha 2011;
Bolch et al. 2012). Approximately 10% of the summer discharge of the Ganges is attributed
to melt waters from glaciers (Barnett, Adam, and Letternmaier 2005; Jain, Agarwal, and
Singh 2007; Immerzeel, van Beek, and Bierkens 2010; Bolch et al. 2012). Rapid depletion
of glaciers has had adverse effects on the ﬂow regime of major Himalayan rivers, and can
even lead to catastrophic events such as glacial lake outbursts (Govindha 2010; Shrestha,
Eriksson, and Mool 2010; Ashraf, Naz, and Roohi 2012) and consequent ﬂooding in the
upper reaches of these rivers, affecting the lives of millions of people residing in the Indo-
Gangetic plains (Richardson and Reynolds 2000; Bolch et al. 2012).
In spite of their hydrologic, climatic, and socioeconomic signiﬁcance, opportunities for
precise and continuous monitoring of the Himalayan glaciers are limited by logistical and
terrain-induced difﬁculties. Observations of Earth’s surface using satellite data have proven
to be very useful in such monitoring; recent developments in high-resolution image acqui-
sition have facilitated more precise monitoring of glacier movement (Luckman, Quincey,
and Bevan 2007; Kumar, Venkataraman, and Hogda 2011; Kumar et al. 2011). Further,
satellite data enables a gross analysis of glacier mass budgets, overcoming some of the
problems of accessibility and sustainability of long-term measurements, that can later be
veriﬁed with ground-based surveys (Kumar et al. 2008). The potential of remote sensing
for glacier mass balance and velocity mapping has been demonstrated with optical (e.g.
Kääb 2005; Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker 2008), synthetic aperture radar (SAR) (e.g.
Luckman, Quincey, and Bevan 2007), and thermal infrared sensors (e.g. Nakawo, Yabuki,
and Sakai 1999), and elevation models (Bolch, Pieczonka, and Benn 2011), among others.
Developments in deriving ﬂow rates and monitoring Himalayan glacier retreat using optical
images have been made by Kääb (2005). However, this approach is sometimes limited by
weather, clouds, and shadows in areas of high relief.
In a novel approach, the current study presents one of the most comprehensive assess-
ments of the Gangotri glacier in recent times (2004–2011). The methodology entails the
utilization of interferometric SAR (InSAR) coherence and sub-pixel offset tracking. While
complementing most previous studies, the result presented here establishes the effective-
ness of the techniques implemented to produce robust estimates of areal changes and glacier
surface velocity in near real time. But, perhaps most importantly, this is one of the few stud-
ies which has shown the melting trend of Gangotri glacier over a considerably continuous
period during recent times (2004–2011).

Study area
The Gangotri glacier is a valley-type glacier and one of the largest Himalayan glaciers
located in Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand, India (Figure 1). Extending between the lat-
itudes 30◦ 43′ 22′′ N–30◦ 55′ 49′′ N and longitudes 79◦ 4′ 41′′ E–79◦ 16′ 34′′ E, Gangotri
is the only major Himalayan glacier that ﬂows towards the northwest. It spans a length
of 30.2 km, its width varies between 0.20 and 2.35 km, and it thereby covers an area of
about 86.32 km2. While the average thickness of the Gangotri glacier is ∼200 m, its sur-
face elevation varies from 4000 to 7000 m above mean sea level (Jain 2008). Gangotri has
three main tributaries, namely the Raktvarna, the Chaturangi, and the Kirti, with lengths

18 small tributary glaciers of Gangotri and its tributaries. Gangotri and other glaciers in
this region are mostly fed by the summer monsoon and partly by winter snow. Western
disturbances cause heavy snowfall from December to March over this region (Thayyen and
Gergan 2010). Generally, seasonal melting starts in the month of May and continues till
October (Dobhal, Gergan, and Thayyen 2008).

Data and methods
3.1.
Coherence detection for glacier retreat
InSAR provides avenues to study glaciers in terms of snout and glacial lake monitoring, as
well as ground displacement and topographic variations, using interferograms (Luckman,
Quincey, and Bevan 2007; Kumar et al. 2008; Capps et al. 2010). Glacier monitoring using
InSAR is advancing towards new frontiers; in this study, we develop coherence maps using
SAR image pairs to map the location of the snout of the Gangotri glacier. Previously, this
technique has been utilized to delineate glacier extent (Atwood, Meyer, and Arendt 2010)
and to identify debris-covered portions of glaciers in the northwest Himalayas (Frey, Paul,
and Strozzi 2012). In this study, we utilize the coherency attribute between two SAR images
for snout monitoring. We estimate coherence of interferograms made from two SAR acqui-
sitions with the spatial correlation of the InSAR phase over small areas of pixels (Fielding
et al. 2005). This phase correlation is related to the relative displacement of the scatter-
ing objects within each pixel and large surface motion during the time between two SAR
acquisitions. While higher values of coherence are associated with small motion and disrup-
tion of the surface, lower values are representative of considerable displacement or surface
changes over a speciﬁed time period. Practically, it can help in understanding the stabil-
ity of the terrain imaged. Ice, which is constantly melting and accumulating in addition
to ﬂowing laterally, shows very low relative coherence even if the images have a small
temporal baseline. InSAR coherence estimates typically involve a bias of ∼20% in areas

P. Saraswat et al.
of low coherence, so we consider relative values of coherence instead of the absolute val-
ues in order to characterize the stability of the surface. The terminus, where the ground is
exposed as a consequence of glacier retreat, shows better coherence compared to the pix-
els within the glacier (Atwood, Meyer, and Arendt 2010). To delineate a high coherence
zone, which is ice-free ground, we apply a threshold of 0.4 (40%) to InSAR correlation to
select the areas of high coherence from the interferograms. This is based on the assump-
tion that high coherence values are largely due to the presence of ice-free surface near the
glacier snout. The retreat rate is calculated as the distance measured between the mapped
snout in ﬁrst image pair (in this case 2004–2005) and last image pair (2009–2010) along
the central ﬂow line of the glacier. However, coherence of the non-glaciated portions of
land ahead of the terminus may be subsequently affected by ﬂowing melt water from the
glacier. This shortcoming was surpassed by selecting images during early summer (March–
May) and early winter (October–December) with relatively short acquisition intervals over
the Gangotri region. The coherence analysis is based on InSAR, incorporating data sets
acquired by the advanced synthetic aperture radar (ASAR) instrument mounted on the
Envisat satellite (Image Mode; see Table 1). The orbital models for Envisat used in this
study were obtained from ESA Doris orbits (DOR) and processing was performed with
the JPL/Caltech ROI_pac software (Rosen et al. 2004). Digital elevation model (DEM)
data are required to remove and model topographic phase contributions, and to orthorec-
tify the data for intercomparison. Here, we use NASA’s Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission
(SRTM) (Rodriguez, Morris, and Belz 2006) DEM with voids ﬁlled by other sources, avail-
able from Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) Consortium
for Spatial Information (CGIAR-CSI) (http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/). These void-ﬁlled DEMs
(SRTM CGIAR version 3) are particularly effective for the study area since they are
constructed using topographic maps and information from local topography.
However, at times InSAR fails to produce reliable measurements of ice motion for
fast moving glaciers primarily due to temporal decorrelation or loss of coherence, in the
absence of optimal temporal baseline between the image pairs. This aspect is one of the
major limitations associated with this technique. Further, steep slopes, particularly in the
Gangotri region, inhibit an across-track view of the glacier and render SAR data from the
widely available satellites unreliable for glacier velocity measurements. Due to the absence
of Envisat SAR pairs with short time intervals over the study area (minimum possible

repeat time of Envisat was 35 days, but not every orbit had SAR images acquired), tem-
poral decorrelation is a major issue encountered in this study. For the available pairs, the
glacier motion is large enough to cause incoherent InSAR leading to temporal decorrela-
tion. Hence, the absence of good coherence between subsequent SAR image pairs makes it
difﬁcult to measure the Gangotri ice velocity with Envisat InSAR.
3.2.
Velocity measurements using pixel offset tracking
Mapping the glacier surface velocity is crucial for characterizing ice dynamics and quan-
tifying glacier ice mass balance (Bindschadler and Scambos 1991; Joughin et al. 2002;
Rignot and Thomas 2002). In order to overcome the previously mentioned region-speciﬁc
limitation of InSAR in mapping glacier velocity, we took an alternative approach to monitor
glacier velocities utilizing sub-pixel offset tracking on nadir-viewing near infrared (NIR)
imagery from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reﬂection Radiometer
(ASTER). This technique utilizes cross-correlation between two images to estimate sur-
face velocities, details of which are illustrated in Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008).
Pixel offset tracking or sub-pixel correlation is a technique to measure the motion of spa-
tially coherent features through time between two images (Crippen 1992). In glaciology,
these features generally consist of crevasses, undulations, and moraines (Konig, Winther,
and Isaksson 2001). The horizontal displacement thus obtained can be used to generate
velocity maps utilizing the time difference between the images pairs. In this study, the
ENVI- and IDL-based processing software, Co-registration of Optically Sensed Images
and Correlation (COSI-Corr) (Leprince et al. 2007), is used for the said purpose. This
method has been successfully used for measuring glacier velocities such as those in Stearns,
Hamilton, and Reeh (2005), Howat et al. (2008), Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008),
Debella-Gilo and Kääb (2011), Herman, Anderson, and Leprince (2011), and Willis et al.
(2012). Initially, a DEM is used to generate approximate tie points for the master image,
and we used the same SRTM 3-arcsecond DEM with the voids ﬁlled by the CGIAR group
(Version 3) as described above. Tie points are then subjected to an optimization algo-
rithm in order to generate precise ground control points to orthorectify the master image.
Once the master image is orthorectiﬁed, ensuing slave images are orthorectiﬁed using
the same master image. After successful orthorectiﬁcation and co-registration of image
pairs, a correlation algorithm is then applied by moving the correlation windows across
the prepared images on a regular grid. Distinctive features are tracked between image
pairs and their displacement is calculated to produce displacement maps and their cor-
responding signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) maps. Note that the methodology implemented
here is exactly the same as that presented in Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008)
and is most appropriate for additional details on the methodology and functionality of
COSI-Corr.
In order to overcome the limitation of producing high quality velocity estimates from
InSAR, a sub-pixel correlation or offset tracking technique is employed on ASTER L1A
satellite imagery acquired for the region. Table 2 enlists the details of the ASTER L1A data
set analysed in this study. For better results, maximum care is taken to obtain images with
less snowfall and cloud cover, especially over the Gangotri glacier. In order to analyse the
motion over the entire length of the glacier, we acquired ASTER L1A data for two frames
covering the lower and upper reaches of the Gangotri glacier. Both frames were acquired on
the same date and with the same acquisition parameters but processed separately. Another
associated advantage of ASTER imagery over SAR imagery for such difﬁcult terrain is the

availability of the 3N (NIR) band with nadir-viewing geometry and 15 m spatial resolution,
thus minimizing topography-induced errors in the velocity estimates. The images used in
this study are mostly acquired during the month of October, which is the end of the melting
season.
3.3.
Uncertainty analysis
A number of factors contribute to uncertainties in the coherence-based estimates of glacier
retreat rate, including DEM, orbital, and baseline errors. Errors in velocity estimates
obtained using pixel offset tracking can again be attributed primarily to DEM errors, which
are transferred in the form of orthorectiﬁcation errors to the orthorectiﬁed master image.
The SRTM 3-arcsecond DEM that we used has voids ﬁlled by the CGIAR group (Version
3), so the DEM quality is variable. The voids in SRTM version 2 are extensive in the steep
slopes of the Himalayas. We chose ASTER pairs with the same look angle to minimize the
effects of DEM errors since both images have the same viewing geometry. Kääb (2002)
discussed these anomalies as a ground position error, which is about 3 m for moderately
inclined terrains.
Additionally, uncertainties from resampling and image cross-correlation processes are
generally much smaller than the pixel size of 15 m; hence, matches with uncertainties
greater than one pixel are usually discarded during the processing (Scherler, Leprince, and
Strecker 2008). The cumulative error in velocity estimates is less than 5 m year−1 for the
data sets used in this study. This error is estimated by computing surface velocity for loca-
tions where stable ground is exposed typically near the snout to keep other inﬂuencing
factors such as slope and surface conditions as close to the glacier as possible. Since surface
velocity should be ideally zero in these locations, any value other than zero is approximated
as the error. In order to quantify the error, we concentrated on velocities estimated for an
area in front of the snout (Figure 4(a) (Box 1)), which is observed to be ice-free in all of
the images used in this study. Analysis showed that velocities estimated in this study suffer

from a possible bias (mean) of about 4.2 m year−1 and an error (standard deviation) of
about 2.3 m year−1. The high precision in the observed estimates can be attributed to sev-
eral factors such as (1) low cloud cover in the ASTER images, (2) the scenes are obtained
for the same time period (late summer and fall), which helped to eliminate errors related to
snowfall and changes in solar illumination, and (3) the time span between paired ASTER
images are mostly kept at nearly 1 year, which provides a resolvable time window to derive
glacier surface velocities.

Results
4.1.
Glacier recession from 2004–2010
Shown in Figures 2(a) and (b) are the InSAR coherence maps of the Gangotri glacier region
obtained from image pairs with the shortest possible acquisition intervals in order to locate
the snout of the glacier with improved accuracy. The detail of interferometric pairs chosen
to study short and long-term variations of the Gangotri glacier is shown in Table 1. For the
reasons stated above we present results from coherence mapping for Pair 1 (Figure 2(a)) and
Pair 6 (Figure 2(b)). Thus, it can be observed in Figures 2(a) and (b) that by stretching the
values in the coherence maps, the majority of the region registered low coherence, caused
mainly due to accumulation and ablation of snow and ice and also due to steep slopes.
However, regions near the northern ﬂank of the glacier show high coherence (>40%),
which is attributed to the fact that the snout of the glacier has retreated, exposing boulders
and moraines. Hence, these are the areas which show more relative stability over a consid-
erable period of time (typically a few months). Areas further down the valley are likewise
seasonally snow-free but have considerable vegetation (as evident in ASTER scenes, not
shown), which produces low coherence in the image. Thus, high coherence occurs only in
those areas recently exposed by glacial retreat and not yet covered by signiﬁcant vegetation
growth, i.e. only near the glacier snout.
See Table 3 for the snout positions obtained during the period of Pair 1 (2004–2005),
Pair 5, and Pair 6 (2009–2010). These results correlate very well with the snout posi-
tions reported in a previous study, using ground-based surveys (Kumar et al. 2008). The
colour code used in Figure 2(a) and (b) shows two dominant shades, blue representing low
coherence, which is quite apparent over this region since continuous snowfall and melting,
renders most of the region incoherent. The assumption made here is that the newly exposed
surface material adjacent to the snout of the glacier, deposited by continuous recession
of the terminus, should show coherence values well above 40% and is represented by red
zones near the northern ﬂank of the glacier in Figure 2(a) and (b). The average recession
rate of the Gangotri glacier for the period 2004–2010, based on the distance between the
two snout positions (along the central ﬂow line of the glacier), obtained from the coherence
maps (Table 3), is estimated to be 21.3 ± 3 m year−1.
The recession trend is indirectly linked to the glacier mass balance, which is the net
accumulation and ablation within a year measured as the difference between the amount
of snow accumulated in winter and ice removed by melting in summer. The coherence
maps computed from each of the pairs provide insight into the extent of ice-free surface
observed during the respective time periods. Hence, stacking each of these coherence maps
will highlight the area over which terminus retreat has occurred over the entire period of
2004–2010, yielding a holistic view of the ice-free area cleared by ice over the region cov-
ered by the Gangotri glacier and its tributaries. Figure 3 shows the colour-coded coherence
map obtained by stacking the coherence images from Pairs 1, 5, and 6. This represents

around the month of October during 2005–2006, 2009–2010, and 2010–2011, that covered
the entire Gangotri glacier in two frames. This enables a recent and periodic assessment of
Gangotri glacier dynamics. Figure 4 represents a cumulative analysis plot of the Gangotri
glacier motion. A Euclidean norm of the displacement measured in the north–south and

pairs (indicated by bright red colour), with a maximum value of 40 ± 2.3 m year−1 in the
lower glacier (Pair 1) and 70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1 in the upper glacier (Pair 4). Considering
the time difference between the two concerned pairs, the velocity of the Gangotri glacier,
during this period, is estimated to be a maximum of 70.2 m year−1 near the head of the
glacier and less than 30 ± 2.3 m year−1 near the snout of the glacier. It is also evident from
Figure 4(a) that the Gangotri glacier recorded higher motion than the surrounding region of
steep mountain slopes, which had near zero net motion. A clear indication of glacier move-
ment is also apparent from the deﬁnite pattern of motion illustrated in the vector ﬁeld plot
shown in Figure 4(b). Streamlines of velocity vectors (shown in Figure 4(b)) clearly demar-
cate the glacier extent and illustrate the magnitude and direction of glacier ice motion.
In order to demonstrate, in greater detail, velocity variations within the Gangotri
glacier during the span of 2005–2011, glacier surface velocity along the central ﬂow line
of Gangotri (Figure 4(b)) is analysed for each of the images pairs (Table 2). Shown in
Figures 4(c) and (d) is the velocity versus distance curve drawn along the proﬁle line (Line
AB for Pairs 1, 2, and 3 and CD for Pair 4 and 5 in Figure 4(b)). As observed from the pro-
ﬁle plot for the lower reaches of Gangotri (Figure 4(c)), surface velocity variation is almost
similar for all the three pairs. However, the annual ﬂow rate for Pair 1 (2005–2006) is
comparatively lower than that of Pair 2 (2009–2010) and Pair 3 (2010–2011), particu-
larly near the snout and in the lower reaches of the glacier. In general, surface velocity
is larger at higher reaches of the glacier as compared to those near the lower reaches and
is likely dependent on variations in the glacier slope, width, and thickness. This pattern
is also evident from the proﬁle plot for higher reaches of the glacier (Figure 4(d) (also
see supplementary Figure S1 at http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2013.845923), where
the glacier mass velocity is considerably higher near the head of the Gangotri glacier, for
both the image pairs. While surface velocity near the snout, for all the time periods, varied
between 24.8 ± 2.3 to 28.9 ± 2.3 m year−1, velocities away from the snout varied between
a minimum of 13.9 ± 2.3 m year−1 to a maximum of 70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1 (in the upper
reaches of the glacier). The average velocity for the image pairs, 1, 2, and 3, are 28.1 ± 2.3,
27.9 ± 2.3, and 28.2 ± 2.3 m year−1, respectively, which is considerably lower than the
average velocities for Pair 4 and Pair 5, which are 45.7 ± 2.3 and 50.4 ± 2.3 m year−1,
respectively.

Discussion
Glacier surface velocity and retreat rate are two very important parameters that are used to
characterize glacier dynamics. This study has produced reliable estimates of both of these
parameters. The methodology involved the utilization of coherence mapping and image
stacking to locate and monitor snout movement as well as quantify the zone of melting
over a considerable time span. The observed snout positions between 2004 and 2010 are
commensurate with those observed in earlier studies. Gangotri glacier retreat rate observed
in this study is comparable to rates of 23 m year−1 (for 1985–2001) (Hasnain, Ahmad,
and Kumar 2004; Cruz et al. 2007), 17.15 m year−1 (1971–2004) (Raina 2009), 23.2 m
year−1 (for 1968–2001) (Bhambri, Bolch, and Chaujar 2011a, 2011b), and 19.9 m year−1
(for 1965–2006) (Bhambri, Bolch, and Chaujar 2012). The most recent estimate of glacier
retreat using the differential global positioning system (DGPS) and satellite imagery was
obtained to be 17.59 m year−1 for the period of 1976–2009 (Kumar, Areendran, and Rao
2009). Table 4 summarizes some of the most recently published retreat rates of the Gangotri
glacier. The retreat rate measured in this study corroborates well with most of the long-term

measurements, estimated over the past 70 years, which also establishes the efﬁcacy of the
methodology presented here. And perhaps most importantly, the results presented here indi-
cate that the most recent retreat rate of the Gangotri glacier conﬁrms a continuous retreat
of the glacier with a consistent rate taking into consideration multidecadal measurements.
The current study also addresses the phenomenon of temporal decorrelation and associ-
ated limitations of InSAR with longer time intervals for surface velocity measurements
and DEM generation for this particular region of the Eastern Himalayas. Sub-pixel offset
tracking, utilizing ASTER data, enabled high-resolution measurements of surface ice-mass
velocity, which is particularly relevant in difﬁcult mountainous terrains such as that of the
present study area (e.g. Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker 2008). A comprehensive analysis
of surface velocity of the Gangotri glacier is performed for the entire length, from snout to
the head, of the glacier. In general, the observed surface velocity variations of the Gangotri
glacier are comparatively similar for the entire range of image pairs (between 2005 and
2011) acquired for this study. However, the magnitude of glacier motion is typically low
for the period 2005–2006, which was also reported in Raina (2009). While the majority of
the incongruence amongst the spatial distribution of surface velocity is noted in the upper
reaches of the glacier, velocities near the snout are almost similar over all time periods. The
annual variations are high, which indicates fast motion of the Gangotri glacier, especially
during the period 2009–2011. These estimates are considerably higher than the short-term
estimates made by Kumar, Venkataraman, and Hogda (2011), Kumar et al. (2011), and
yearly estimates by Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008). Such high surface velocities
may indicate that ice motion in this region is dominated by basal sliding in the ablation
zone of this relatively steep glacier. The velocities estimated here are based on cumula-
tive surface displacement experienced by the glacier over a period of 1 year. Hence, these
velocity estimates do not reﬂect on its seasonal variation. The surface velocity variations
are most comparable for Pairs 2 and 3. However, on average, surface velocity is observed
to be lower during 2005–2006 compared to 2010–2011. These year-to-year variations can
be attributed to factors such as variations in meteorological conditions (Singh et al. 2006)
and the amount of basal sliding (Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker 2008) over the years.
However, yearly differences in the amount of basal sliding due to the variation in melt
water ﬂux can be a contributory factor.
The current study has the potential to provide an integrated assessment of glacier ﬂow
dynamics, to complement previous and future studies in the area and to provide a key
methodology to delineate glacial lake formation (Quincey et al. 2007; Bolch et al. 2011),
which is of major concern in the Himalayan glaciers.

Conclusions
This study provides comprehensive characterization of the dynamics of the Gangotri glacier
in terms of retreat rate and surface velocity estimates over a continuous period from 2004 to
2010. We employed SAR interferometry to quantify the snout retreat of the Gangotri glacier
in the Himalayas, exploring its capabilities for an integrated assessment of the glacier.
Results showed that the Gangotri glacier, which is one of the largest Himalayan glaciers,
retreated about 119 m over a period of 6 years (2004–2010), at an average rate of 21.3 ± 3 m
year−1. In the context of previous studies, the rate has been almost the same for the last
couple of decades. The results also demonstrated that retreat rate of the terminus was not
uniform over the 6-year period. Further, stacking coherence images from different SAR
pairs delineated the area cleared by ice from 2004 to 2010, facilitating a broader idea about
melting of Gangotri and its tributary glaciers. Results from the sub-pixel offset tracking of
ASTER images revealed signiﬁcant motion along the length of the glacier and its tributaries
compared to the surrounding region, meanwhile establishing a better picture of ﬂow char-
acteristics of the Gangotri glacier. High velocities were observed at the upper reaches of the
glacier while comparatively less movement was observed near the snout. Speciﬁcally, while
the average glacier surface velocity was estimated to be about 36.1 ± 2.3 m year−1, over the
period 2005–2011, the maximum and minimum velocities ranged between 13.9 ± 2.3 and
70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1. Overall, variation of surface velocity of ice mass over the entire length
of the Gangotri glacier was approximately similar for all of the image pairs studied for the
period 2005–2011. While most previous studies suggest a decrease in retreat rate based on
observations made over short time period (e.g. Kumar et al. 2008), our study, which is based
on almost continuous measurements over a period of 6 years, suggests that the glacier is
melting at a constant rate, which is in accordance with long-term estimates measured since
1965. Such observations are useful in assessing the glacier’s response to climate change
and provide an avenue to understand glacier dynamics and its relation to glacier surface
morphology.

Glacier mass variations have a direct impact on some of the key components of the
global water cycle, including sea level rise and freshwater availability. Apart from being
one of the largest Himalayan glaciers, Gangotri is one of the sources of water for the
Ganges river, which has a considerable inﬂuence on the socioeconomic structure of a
largely over-populated catchment area accounting for ∼26% of India’s landmass. In this
study, we present the most recent assessment of the Gangotri glacier dynamics, combin-
ing the use of interferometric techniques on synthetic aperture radar data and sub-pixel
offset tracking on Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reﬂection Radiometer
(ASTER) satellite imagery. Results show that on average, the Gangotri glacier snout
has receded at a rate of 21.3 ± 3 m year−1 over a period of 6 years (2004–2010).
While glacier surface velocity near the snout is estimated to be between 24.8 ± 2.3 and
28.9 ± 2.3 m year−1, interior portions of the glacier recorded velocities in the range of
13.9 ± 2.3 to 70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1. Further, the average glacier surface velocity in the
northern (lower) portions (28.1 ± 2.3 m year−1) is observed to be signiﬁcantly lower
than in the southern (higher) portions (48.1 ± 2.3 m year−1) of the Gangotri glacier.
These values are calculated with an uncertainty of less than 5 m year−1. Results also
highlight a consistent retreat and non-uniform dynamics of the Gangotri glacier.

Introduction
The impact of climate change on glaciers of the world has been a topic of active concern
in recent times (Syed et al. 2007; Bagla 2009; Cogley et al. 2010). While glacial melt is a
major source of freshwater that contributes to global mean sea level rise (Meier et al. 2007;
Jacob et al. 2012), decreasing glacial mass has an impact on the freshwater resources of
some of the largest river basins in the world, including that of the Ganges (e.g. Kumar,
Singh, and Sharma 2005; Mall et al. 2006; Immerzeel, van Beek, and Bierkens 2010;
Kaser, Grosshauser, and Marzeion 2010). Fluctuations in the recession rate of glaciers dur-
ing recent years have initiated widespread discussions, especially in the context of global
warming and its effects (Dyurgerov and Meier 2005). Similar ice mass changes have also
been reported in the Garhwal region of the Himalayas (Kulkarni et al. 2005; Bhambri,
Bolch, and Chaujar 2011a, 2011b; Kulkarni et al. 2011; Bolch et al. 2012). However, the

status of the Gangotri glacier warrants further investigation, particularly in the context of
climate change resulting in continuous retreat, negative mass balance, and early melting of
seasonal snow cover (Negi et al. 2012).
Glaciers cover about 40,800 km2 of the Himalayan and Karakoram mountain region,
and are one of the main sources of water to some of the largest rivers in the world, including
the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Indus (Kulkarni et al. 2011; Bajracharya and Shrestha 2011;
Bolch et al. 2012). Approximately 10% of the summer discharge of the Ganges is attributed
to melt waters from glaciers (Barnett, Adam, and Letternmaier 2005; Jain, Agarwal, and
Singh 2007; Immerzeel, van Beek, and Bierkens 2010; Bolch et al. 2012). Rapid depletion
of glaciers has had adverse effects on the ﬂow regime of major Himalayan rivers, and can
even lead to catastrophic events such as glacial lake outbursts (Govindha 2010; Shrestha,
Eriksson, and Mool 2010; Ashraf, Naz, and Roohi 2012) and consequent ﬂooding in the
upper reaches of these rivers, affecting the lives of millions of people residing in the Indo-
Gangetic plains (Richardson and Reynolds 2000; Bolch et al. 2012).
In spite of their hydrologic, climatic, and socioeconomic signiﬁcance, opportunities for
precise and continuous monitoring of the Himalayan glaciers are limited by logistical and
terrain-induced difﬁculties. Observations of Earth’s surface using satellite data have proven
to be very useful in such monitoring; recent developments in high-resolution image acqui-
sition have facilitated more precise monitoring of glacier movement (Luckman, Quincey,
and Bevan 2007; Kumar, Venkataraman, and Hogda 2011; Kumar et al. 2011). Further,
satellite data enables a gross analysis of glacier mass budgets, overcoming some of the
problems of accessibility and sustainability of long-term measurements, that can later be
veriﬁed with ground-based surveys (Kumar et al. 2008). The potential of remote sensing
for glacier mass balance and velocity mapping has been demonstrated with optical (e.g.
Kääb 2005; Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker 2008), synthetic aperture radar (SAR) (e.g.
Luckman, Quincey, and Bevan 2007), and thermal infrared sensors (e.g. Nakawo, Yabuki,
and Sakai 1999), and elevation models (Bolch, Pieczonka, and Benn 2011), among others.
Developments in deriving ﬂow rates and monitoring Himalayan glacier retreat using optical
images have been made by Kääb (2005). However, this approach is sometimes limited by
weather, clouds, and shadows in areas of high relief.
In a novel approach, the current study presents one of the most comprehensive assess-
ments of the Gangotri glacier in recent times (2004–2011). The methodology entails the
utilization of interferometric SAR (InSAR) coherence and sub-pixel offset tracking. While
complementing most previous studies, the result presented here establishes the effective-
ness of the techniques implemented to produce robust estimates of areal changes and glacier
surface velocity in near real time. But, perhaps most importantly, this is one of the few stud-
ies which has shown the melting trend of Gangotri glacier over a considerably continuous
period during recent times (2004–2011).

Study area
The Gangotri glacier is a valley-type glacier and one of the largest Himalayan glaciers
located in Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand, India (Figure 1). Extending between the lat-
itudes 30◦ 43′ 22′′ N–30◦ 55′ 49′′ N and longitudes 79◦ 4′ 41′′ E–79◦ 16′ 34′′ E, Gangotri
is the only major Himalayan glacier that ﬂows towards the northwest. It spans a length
of 30.2 km, its width varies between 0.20 and 2.35 km, and it thereby covers an area of
about 86.32 km2. While the average thickness of the Gangotri glacier is ∼200 m, its sur-
face elevation varies from 4000 to 7000 m above mean sea level (Jain 2008). Gangotri has
three main tributaries, namely the Raktvarna, the Chaturangi, and the Kirti, with lengths

of 15.90, 22.45, and 11.05 km, respectively (Figure 1). Additionally, there are more than
18 small tributary glaciers of Gangotri and its tributaries. Gangotri and other glaciers in
this region are mostly fed by the summer monsoon and partly by winter snow. Western
disturbances cause heavy snowfall from December to March over this region (Thayyen and
Gergan 2010). Generally, seasonal melting starts in the month of May and continues till
October (Dobhal, Gergan, and Thayyen 2008).

Data and methods
3.1.
Coherence detection for glacier retreat
InSAR provides avenues to study glaciers in terms of snout and glacial lake monitoring, as
well as ground displacement and topographic variations, using interferograms (Luckman,
Quincey, and Bevan 2007; Kumar et al. 2008; Capps et al. 2010). Glacier monitoring using
InSAR is advancing towards new frontiers; in this study, we develop coherence maps using
SAR image pairs to map the location of the snout of the Gangotri glacier. Previously, this
technique has been utilized to delineate glacier extent (Atwood, Meyer, and Arendt 2010)
and to identify debris-covered portions of glaciers in the northwest Himalayas (Frey, Paul,
and Strozzi 2012). In this study, we utilize the coherency attribute between two SAR images
for snout monitoring. We estimate coherence of interferograms made from two SAR acqui-
sitions with the spatial correlation of the InSAR phase over small areas of pixels (Fielding
et al. 2005). This phase correlation is related to the relative displacement of the scatter-
ing objects within each pixel and large surface motion during the time between two SAR
acquisitions. While higher values of coherence are associated with small motion and disrup-
tion of the surface, lower values are representative of considerable displacement or surface
changes over a speciﬁed time period. Practically, it can help in understanding the stabil-
ity of the terrain imaged. Ice, which is constantly melting and accumulating in addition
to ﬂowing laterally, shows very low relative coherence even if the images have a small
temporal baseline. InSAR coherence estimates typically involve a bias of ∼20% in areas

P. Saraswat et al.
of low coherence, so we consider relative values of coherence instead of the absolute val-
ues in order to characterize the stability of the surface. The terminus, where the ground is
exposed as a consequence of glacier retreat, shows better coherence compared to the pix-
els within the glacier (Atwood, Meyer, and Arendt 2010). To delineate a high coherence
zone, which is ice-free ground, we apply a threshold of 0.4 (40%) to InSAR correlation to
select the areas of high coherence from the interferograms. This is based on the assump-
tion that high coherence values are largely due to the presence of ice-free surface near the
glacier snout. The retreat rate is calculated as the distance measured between the mapped
snout in ﬁrst image pair (in this case 2004–2005) and last image pair (2009–2010) along
the central ﬂow line of the glacier. However, coherence of the non-glaciated portions of
land ahead of the terminus may be subsequently affected by ﬂowing melt water from the
glacier. This shortcoming was surpassed by selecting images during early summer (March–
May) and early winter (October–December) with relatively short acquisition intervals over
the Gangotri region. The coherence analysis is based on InSAR, incorporating data sets
acquired by the advanced synthetic aperture radar (ASAR) instrument mounted on the
Envisat satellite (Image Mode; see Table 1). The orbital models for Envisat used in this
study were obtained from ESA Doris orbits (DOR) and processing was performed with
the JPL/Caltech ROI_pac software (Rosen et al. 2004). Digital elevation model (DEM)
data are required to remove and model topographic phase contributions, and to orthorec-
tify the data for intercomparison. Here, we use NASA’s Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission
(SRTM) (Rodriguez, Morris, and Belz 2006) DEM with voids ﬁlled by other sources, avail-
able from Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) Consortium
for Spatial Information (CGIAR-CSI) (http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/). These void-ﬁlled DEMs
(SRTM CGIAR version 3) are particularly effective for the study area since they are
constructed using topographic maps and information from local topography.
However, at times InSAR fails to produce reliable measurements of ice motion for
fast moving glaciers primarily due to temporal decorrelation or loss of coherence, in the
absence of optimal temporal baseline between the image pairs. This aspect is one of the
major limitations associated with this technique. Further, steep slopes, particularly in the
Gangotri region, inhibit an across-track view of the glacier and render SAR data from the
widely available satellites unreliable for glacier velocity measurements. Due to the absence
of Envisat SAR pairs with short time intervals over the study area (minimum possible

repeat time of Envisat was 35 days, but not every orbit had SAR images acquired), tem-
poral decorrelation is a major issue encountered in this study. For the available pairs, the
glacier motion is large enough to cause incoherent InSAR leading to temporal decorrela-
tion. Hence, the absence of good coherence between subsequent SAR image pairs makes it
difﬁcult to measure the Gangotri ice velocity with Envisat InSAR.
3.2.
Velocity measurements using pixel offset tracking
Mapping the glacier surface velocity is crucial for characterizing ice dynamics and quan-
tifying glacier ice mass balance (Bindschadler and Scambos 1991; Joughin et al. 2002;
Rignot and Thomas 2002). In order to overcome the previously mentioned region-speciﬁc
limitation of InSAR in mapping glacier velocity, we took an alternative approach to monitor
glacier velocities utilizing sub-pixel offset tracking on nadir-viewing near infrared (NIR)
imagery from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reﬂection Radiometer
(ASTER). This technique utilizes cross-correlation between two images to estimate sur-
face velocities, details of which are illustrated in Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008).
Pixel offset tracking or sub-pixel correlation is a technique to measure the motion of spa-
tially coherent features through time between two images (Crippen 1992). In glaciology,
these features generally consist of crevasses, undulations, and moraines (Konig, Winther,
and Isaksson 2001). The horizontal displacement thus obtained can be used to generate
velocity maps utilizing the time difference between the images pairs. In this study, the
ENVI- and IDL-based processing software, Co-registration of Optically Sensed Images
and Correlation (COSI-Corr) (Leprince et al. 2007), is used for the said purpose. This
method has been successfully used for measuring glacier velocities such as those in Stearns,
Hamilton, and Reeh (2005), Howat et al. (2008), Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008),
Debella-Gilo and Kääb (2011), Herman, Anderson, and Leprince (2011), and Willis et al.
(2012). Initially, a DEM is used to generate approximate tie points for the master image,
and we used the same SRTM 3-arcsecond DEM with the voids ﬁlled by the CGIAR group
(Version 3) as described above. Tie points are then subjected to an optimization algo-
rithm in order to generate precise ground control points to orthorectify the master image.
Once the master image is orthorectiﬁed, ensuing slave images are orthorectiﬁed using
the same master image. After successful orthorectiﬁcation and co-registration of image
pairs, a correlation algorithm is then applied by moving the correlation windows across
the prepared images on a regular grid. Distinctive features are tracked between image
pairs and their displacement is calculated to produce displacement maps and their cor-
responding signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) maps. Note that the methodology implemented
here is exactly the same as that presented in Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008)
and is most appropriate for additional details on the methodology and functionality of
COSI-Corr.
In order to overcome the limitation of producing high quality velocity estimates from
InSAR, a sub-pixel correlation or offset tracking technique is employed on ASTER L1A
satellite imagery acquired for the region. Table 2 enlists the details of the ASTER L1A data
set analysed in this study. For better results, maximum care is taken to obtain images with
less snowfall and cloud cover, especially over the Gangotri glacier. In order to analyse the
motion over the entire length of the glacier, we acquired ASTER L1A data for two frames
covering the lower and upper reaches of the Gangotri glacier. Both frames were acquired on
the same date and with the same acquisition parameters but processed separately. Another
associated advantage of ASTER imagery over SAR imagery for such difﬁcult terrain is the

availability of the 3N (NIR) band with nadir-viewing geometry and 15 m spatial resolution,
thus minimizing topography-induced errors in the velocity estimates. The images used in
this study are mostly acquired during the month of October, which is the end of the melting
season.
3.3.
Uncertainty analysis
A number of factors contribute to uncertainties in the coherence-based estimates of glacier
retreat rate, including DEM, orbital, and baseline errors. Errors in velocity estimates
obtained using pixel offset tracking can again be attributed primarily to DEM errors, which
are transferred in the form of orthorectiﬁcation errors to the orthorectiﬁed master image.
The SRTM 3-arcsecond DEM that we used has voids ﬁlled by the CGIAR group (Version
3), so the DEM quality is variable. The voids in SRTM version 2 are extensive in the steep
slopes of the Himalayas. We chose ASTER pairs with the same look angle to minimize the
effects of DEM errors since both images have the same viewing geometry. Kääb (2002)
discussed these anomalies as a ground position error, which is about 3 m for moderately
inclined terrains.
Additionally, uncertainties from resampling and image cross-correlation processes are
generally much smaller than the pixel size of 15 m; hence, matches with uncertainties
greater than one pixel are usually discarded during the processing (Scherler, Leprince, and
Strecker 2008). The cumulative error in velocity estimates is less than 5 m year−1 for the
data sets used in this study. This error is estimated by computing surface velocity for loca-
tions where stable ground is exposed typically near the snout to keep other inﬂuencing
factors such as slope and surface conditions as close to the glacier as possible. Since surface
velocity should be ideally zero in these locations, any value other than zero is approximated
as the error. In order to quantify the error, we concentrated on velocities estimated for an
area in front of the snout (Figure 4(a) (Box 1)), which is observed to be ice-free in all of
the images used in this study. Analysis showed that velocities estimated in this study suffer

8659
from a possible bias (mean) of about 4.2 m year−1 and an error (standard deviation) of
about 2.3 m year−1. The high precision in the observed estimates can be attributed to sev-
eral factors such as (1) low cloud cover in the ASTER images, (2) the scenes are obtained
for the same time period (late summer and fall), which helped to eliminate errors related to
snowfall and changes in solar illumination, and (3) the time span between paired ASTER
images are mostly kept at nearly 1 year, which provides a resolvable time window to derive
glacier surface velocities.

Results
4.1.
Glacier recession from 2004–2010
Shown in Figures 2(a) and (b) are the InSAR coherence maps of the Gangotri glacier region
obtained from image pairs with the shortest possible acquisition intervals in order to locate
the snout of the glacier with improved accuracy. The detail of interferometric pairs chosen
to study short and long-term variations of the Gangotri glacier is shown in Table 1. For the
reasons stated above we present results from coherence mapping for Pair 1 (Figure 2(a)) and
Pair 6 (Figure 2(b)). Thus, it can be observed in Figures 2(a) and (b) that by stretching the
values in the coherence maps, the majority of the region registered low coherence, caused
mainly due to accumulation and ablation of snow and ice and also due to steep slopes.
However, regions near the northern ﬂank of the glacier show high coherence (>40%),
which is attributed to the fact that the snout of the glacier has retreated, exposing boulders
and moraines. Hence, these are the areas which show more relative stability over a consid-
erable period of time (typically a few months). Areas further down the valley are likewise
seasonally snow-free but have considerable vegetation (as evident in ASTER scenes, not
shown), which produces low coherence in the image. Thus, high coherence occurs only in
those areas recently exposed by glacial retreat and not yet covered by signiﬁcant vegetation
growth, i.e. only near the glacier snout.
See Table 3 for the snout positions obtained during the period of Pair 1 (2004–2005),
Pair 5, and Pair 6 (2009–2010). These results correlate very well with the snout posi-
tions reported in a previous study, using ground-based surveys (Kumar et al. 2008). The
colour code used in Figure 2(a) and (b) shows two dominant shades, blue representing low
coherence, which is quite apparent over this region since continuous snowfall and melting,
renders most of the region incoherent. The assumption made here is that the newly exposed
surface material adjacent to the snout of the glacier, deposited by continuous recession
of the terminus, should show coherence values well above 40% and is represented by red
zones near the northern ﬂank of the glacier in Figure 2(a) and (b). The average recession
rate of the Gangotri glacier for the period 2004–2010, based on the distance between the
two snout positions (along the central ﬂow line of the glacier), obtained from the coherence
maps (Table 3), is estimated to be 21.3 ± 3 m year−1.
The recession trend is indirectly linked to the glacier mass balance, which is the net
accumulation and ablation within a year measured as the difference between the amount
of snow accumulated in winter and ice removed by melting in summer. The coherence
maps computed from each of the pairs provide insight into the extent of ice-free surface
observed during the respective time periods. Hence, stacking each of these coherence maps
will highlight the area over which terminus retreat has occurred over the entire period of
2004–2010, yielding a holistic view of the ice-free area cleared by ice over the region cov-
ered by the Gangotri glacier and its tributaries. Figure 3 shows the colour-coded coherence
map obtained by stacking the coherence images from Pairs 1, 5, and 6. This represents

Glacier velocity measurements from 2005–2011
In this study, sub-pixel offset tracking analysis is performed on ASTER pairs, acquired
around the month of October during 2005–2006, 2009–2010, and 2010–2011, that covered
the entire Gangotri glacier in two frames. This enables a recent and periodic assessment of
Gangotri glacier dynamics. Figure 4 represents a cumulative analysis plot of the Gangotri
glacier motion. A Euclidean norm of the displacement measured in the north–south and
east–west direction for Pair 2 and Pair 4 (2009–2010), after mosaicking, is shown in
Figure 4(a). Large magnitudes of velocity are observed over the Gangotri glacier for both

pairs (indicated by bright red colour), with a maximum value of 40 ± 2.3 m year−1 in the
lower glacier (Pair 1) and 70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1 in the upper glacier (Pair 4). Considering
the time difference between the two concerned pairs, the velocity of the Gangotri glacier,
during this period, is estimated to be a maximum of 70.2 m year−1 near the head of the
glacier and less than 30 ± 2.3 m year−1 near the snout of the glacier. It is also evident from
Figure 4(a) that the Gangotri glacier recorded higher motion than the surrounding region of
steep mountain slopes, which had near zero net motion. A clear indication of glacier move-
ment is also apparent from the deﬁnite pattern of motion illustrated in the vector ﬁeld plot
shown in Figure 4(b). Streamlines of velocity vectors (shown in Figure 4(b)) clearly demar-
cate the glacier extent and illustrate the magnitude and direction of glacier ice motion.
In order to demonstrate, in greater detail, velocity variations within the Gangotri
glacier during the span of 2005–2011, glacier surface velocity along the central ﬂow line
of Gangotri (Figure 4(b)) is analysed for each of the images pairs (Table 2). Shown in
Figures 4(c) and (d) is the velocity versus distance curve drawn along the proﬁle line (Line
AB for Pairs 1, 2, and 3 and CD for Pair 4 and 5 in Figure 4(b)). As observed from the pro-
ﬁle plot for the lower reaches of Gangotri (Figure 4(c)), surface velocity variation is almost
similar for all the three pairs. However, the annual ﬂow rate for Pair 1 (2005–2006) is
comparatively lower than that of Pair 2 (2009–2010) and Pair 3 (2010–2011), particu-
larly near the snout and in the lower reaches of the glacier. In general, surface velocity
is larger at higher reaches of the glacier as compared to those near the lower reaches and
is likely dependent on variations in the glacier slope, width, and thickness. This pattern
is also evident from the proﬁle plot for higher reaches of the glacier (Figure 4(d) (also
see supplementary Figure S1 at http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2013.845923), where
the glacier mass velocity is considerably higher near the head of the Gangotri glacier, for
both the image pairs. While surface velocity near the snout, for all the time periods, varied
between 24.8 ± 2.3 to 28.9 ± 2.3 m year−1, velocities away from the snout varied between
a minimum of 13.9 ± 2.3 m year−1 to a maximum of 70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1 (in the upper
reaches of the glacier). The average velocity for the image pairs, 1, 2, and 3, are 28.1 ± 2.3,
27.9 ± 2.3, and 28.2 ± 2.3 m year−1, respectively, which is considerably lower than the
average velocities for Pair 4 and Pair 5, which are 45.7 ± 2.3 and 50.4 ± 2.3 m year−1,
respectively.

Discussion
Glacier surface velocity and retreat rate are two very important parameters that are used to
characterize glacier dynamics. This study has produced reliable estimates of both of these
parameters. The methodology involved the utilization of coherence mapping and image
stacking to locate and monitor snout movement as well as quantify the zone of melting
over a considerable time span. The observed snout positions between 2004 and 2010 are
commensurate with those observed in earlier studies. Gangotri glacier retreat rate observed
in this study is comparable to rates of 23 m year−1 (for 1985–2001) (Hasnain, Ahmad,
and Kumar 2004; Cruz et al. 2007), 17.15 m year−1 (1971–2004) (Raina 2009), 23.2 m
year−1 (for 1968–2001) (Bhambri, Bolch, and Chaujar 2011a, 2011b), and 19.9 m year−1
(for 1965–2006) (Bhambri, Bolch, and Chaujar 2012). The most recent estimate of glacier
retreat using the differential global positioning system (DGPS) and satellite imagery was
obtained to be 17.59 m year−1 for the period of 1976–2009 (Kumar, Areendran, and Rao
2009). Table 4 summarizes some of the most recently published retreat rates of the Gangotri
glacier. The retreat rate measured in this study corroborates well with most of the long-term

measurements, estimated over the past 70 years, which also establishes the efﬁcacy of the
methodology presented here. And perhaps most importantly, the results presented here indi-
cate that the most recent retreat rate of the Gangotri glacier conﬁrms a continuous retreat
of the glacier with a consistent rate taking into consideration multidecadal measurements.
The current study also addresses the phenomenon of temporal decorrelation and associ-
ated limitations of InSAR with longer time intervals for surface velocity measurements
and DEM generation for this particular region of the Eastern Himalayas. Sub-pixel offset
tracking, utilizing ASTER data, enabled high-resolution measurements of surface ice-mass
velocity, which is particularly relevant in difﬁcult mountainous terrains such as that of the
present study area (e.g. Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker 2008). A comprehensive analysis
of surface velocity of the Gangotri glacier is performed for the entire length, from snout to
the head, of the glacier. In general, the observed surface velocity variations of the Gangotri
glacier are comparatively similar for the entire range of image pairs (between 2005 and
2011) acquired for this study. However, the magnitude of glacier motion is typically low
for the period 2005–2006, which was also reported in Raina (2009). While the majority of
the incongruence amongst the spatial distribution of surface velocity is noted in the upper
reaches of the glacier, velocities near the snout are almost similar over all time periods. The
annual variations are high, which indicates fast motion of the Gangotri glacier, especially
during the period 2009–2011. These estimates are considerably higher than the short-term
estimates made by Kumar, Venkataraman, and Hogda (2011), Kumar et al. (2011), and
yearly estimates by Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008). Such high surface velocities
may indicate that ice motion in this region is dominated by basal sliding in the ablation
zone of this relatively steep glacier. The velocities estimated here are based on cumula-
tive surface displacement experienced by the glacier over a period of 1 year. Hence, these
velocity estimates do not reﬂect on its seasonal variation. The surface velocity variations
are most comparable for Pairs 2 and 3. However, on average, surface velocity is observed
to be lower during 2005–2006 compared to 2010–2011. These year-to-year variations can
be attributed to factors such as variations in meteorological conditions (Singh et al. 2006)
and the amount of basal sliding (Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker 2008) over the years.
However, yearly differences in the amount of basal sliding due to the variation in melt
water ﬂux can be a contributory factor.
The current study has the potential to provide an integrated assessment of glacier ﬂow
dynamics, to complement previous and future studies in the area and to provide a key
methodology to delineate glacial lake formation (Quincey et al. 2007; Bolch et al. 2011),
which is of major concern in the Himalayan glaciers.

Conclusions
This study provides comprehensive characterization of the dynamics of the Gangotri glacier
in terms of retreat rate and surface velocity estimates over a continuous period from 2004 to
2010. We employed SAR interferometry to quantify the snout retreat of the Gangotri glacier
in the Himalayas, exploring its capabilities for an integrated assessment of the glacier.
Results showed that the Gangotri glacier, which is one of the largest Himalayan glaciers,
retreated about 119 m over a period of 6 years (2004–2010), at an average rate of 21.3 ± 3 m
year−1. In the context of previous studies, the rate has been almost the same for the last
couple of decades. The results also demonstrated that retreat rate of the terminus was not
uniform over the 6-year period. Further, stacking coherence images from different SAR
pairs delineated the area cleared by ice from 2004 to 2010, facilitating a broader idea about
melting of Gangotri and its tributary glaciers. Results from the sub-pixel offset tracking of
ASTER images revealed signiﬁcant motion along the length of the glacier and its tributaries
compared to the surrounding region, meanwhile establishing a better picture of ﬂow char-
acteristics of the Gangotri glacier. High velocities were observed at the upper reaches of the
glacier while comparatively less movement was observed near the snout. Speciﬁcally, while
the average glacier surface velocity was estimated to be about 36.1 ± 2.3 m year−1, over the
period 2005–2011, the maximum and minimum velocities ranged between 13.9 ± 2.3 and
70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1. Overall, variation of surface velocity of ice mass over the entire length
of the Gangotri glacier was approximately similar for all of the image pairs studied for the
period 2005–2011. While most previous studies suggest a decrease in retreat rate based on
observations made over short time period (e.g. Kumar et al. 2008), our study, which is based
on almost continuous measurements over a period of 6 years, suggests that the glacier is
melting at a constant rate, which is in accordance with long-term estimates measured since
1965. Such observations are useful in assessing the glacier’s response to climate change
and provide an avenue to understand glacier dynamics and its relation to glacier surface
morphology.

Glacier mass variations have a direct impact on some of the key components of the
global water cycle, including sea level rise and freshwater availability. Apart from being
one of the largest Himalayan glaciers, Gangotri is one of the sources of water for the
Ganges river, which has a considerable inﬂuence on the socioeconomic structure of a
largely over-populated catchment area accounting for ∼26% of India’s landmass. In this
study, we present the most recent assessment of the Gangotri glacier dynamics, combin-
ing the use of interferometric techniques on synthetic aperture radar data and sub-pixel
offset tracking on Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reﬂection Radiometer
(ASTER) satellite imagery. Results show that on average, the Gangotri glacier snout
has receded at a rate of 21.3 ± 3 m year−1 over a period of 6 years (2004–2010).
While glacier surface velocity near the snout is estimated to be between 24.8 ± 2.3 and
28.9 ± 2.3 m year−1, interior portions of the glacier recorded velocities in the range of
13.9 ± 2.3 to 70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1. Further, the average glacier surface velocity in the
northern (lower) portions (28.1 ± 2.3 m year−1) is observed to be signiﬁcantly lower
than in the southern (higher) portions (48.1 ± 2.3 m year−1) of the Gangotri glacier.
These values are calculated with an uncertainty of less than 5 m year−1. Results also
highlight a consistent retreat and non-uniform dynamics of the Gangotri glacier.

Introduction
The impact of climate change on glaciers of the world has been a topic of active concern
in recent times (Syed et al. 2007; Bagla 2009; Cogley et al. 2010). While glacial melt is a
major source of freshwater that contributes to global mean sea level rise (Meier et al. 2007;
Jacob et al. 2012), decreasing glacial mass has an impact on the freshwater resources of
some of the largest river basins in the world, including that of the Ganges (e.g. Kumar,
Singh, and Sharma 2005; Mall et al. 2006; Immerzeel, van Beek, and Bierkens 2010;
Kaser, Grosshauser, and Marzeion 2010). Fluctuations in the recession rate of glaciers dur-
ing recent years have initiated widespread discussions, especially in the context of global
warming and its effects (Dyurgerov and Meier 2005). Similar ice mass changes have also
been reported in the Garhwal region of the Himalayas (Kulkarni et al. 2005; Bhambri,
Bolch, and Chaujar 2011a, 2011b; Kulkarni et al. 2011; Bolch et al. 2012). However, the

status of the Gangotri glacier warrants further investigation, particularly in the context of
climate change resulting in continuous retreat, negative mass balance, and early melting of
seasonal snow cover (Negi et al. 2012).
Glaciers cover about 40,800 km2 of the Himalayan and Karakoram mountain region,
and are one of the main sources of water to some of the largest rivers in the world, including
the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Indus (Kulkarni et al. 2011; Bajracharya and Shrestha 2011;
Bolch et al. 2012). Approximately 10% of the summer discharge of the Ganges is attributed
to melt waters from glaciers (Barnett, Adam, and Letternmaier 2005; Jain, Agarwal, and
Singh 2007; Immerzeel, van Beek, and Bierkens 2010; Bolch et al. 2012). Rapid depletion
of glaciers has had adverse effects on the ﬂow regime of major Himalayan rivers, and can
even lead to catastrophic events such as glacial lake outbursts (Govindha 2010; Shrestha,
Eriksson, and Mool 2010; Ashraf, Naz, and Roohi 2012) and consequent ﬂooding in the
upper reaches of these rivers, affecting the lives of millions of people residing in the Indo-
Gangetic plains (Richardson and Reynolds 2000; Bolch et al. 2012).
In spite of their hydrologic, climatic, and socioeconomic signiﬁcance, opportunities for
precise and continuous monitoring of the Himalayan glaciers are limited by logistical and
terrain-induced difﬁculties. Observations of Earth’s surface using satellite data have proven
to be very useful in such monitoring; recent developments in high-resolution image acqui-
sition have facilitated more precise monitoring of glacier movement (Luckman, Quincey,
and Bevan 2007; Kumar, Venkataraman, and Hogda 2011; Kumar et al. 2011). Further,
satellite data enables a gross analysis of glacier mass budgets, overcoming some of the
problems of accessibility and sustainability of long-term measurements, that can later be
veriﬁed with ground-based surveys (Kumar et al. 2008). The potential of remote sensing
for glacier mass balance and velocity mapping has been demonstrated with optical (e.g.
Kääb 2005; Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker 2008), synthetic aperture radar (SAR) (e.g.
Luckman, Quincey, and Bevan 2007), and thermal infrared sensors (e.g. Nakawo, Yabuki,
and Sakai 1999), and elevation models (Bolch, Pieczonka, and Benn 2011), among others.
Developments in deriving ﬂow rates and monitoring Himalayan glacier retreat using optical
images have been made by Kääb (2005). However, this approach is sometimes limited by
weather, clouds, and shadows in areas of high relief.
In a novel approach, the current study presents one of the most comprehensive assess-
ments of the Gangotri glacier in recent times (2004–2011). The methodology entails the
utilization of interferometric SAR (InSAR) coherence and sub-pixel offset tracking. While
complementing most previous studies, the result presented here establishes the effective-
ness of the techniques implemented to produce robust estimates of areal changes and glacier
surface velocity in near real time. But, perhaps most importantly, this is one of the few stud-
ies which has shown the melting trend of Gangotri glacier over a considerably continuous
period during recent times (2004–2011).

Study area
The Gangotri glacier is a valley-type glacier and one of the largest Himalayan glaciers
located in Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand, India (Figure 1). Extending between the lat-
itudes 30◦ 43′ 22′′ N–30◦ 55′ 49′′ N and longitudes 79◦ 4′ 41′′ E–79◦ 16′ 34′′ E, Gangotri
is the only major Himalayan glacier that ﬂows towards the northwest. It spans a length
of 30.2 km, its width varies between 0.20 and 2.35 km, and it thereby covers an area of
about 86.32 km2. While the average thickness of the Gangotri glacier is ∼200 m, its sur-
face elevation varies from 4000 to 7000 m above mean sea level (Jain 2008). Gangotri has
three main tributaries, namely the Raktvarna, the Chaturangi, and the Kirti, with lengths

18 small tributary glaciers of Gangotri and its tributaries. Gangotri and other glaciers in
this region are mostly fed by the summer monsoon and partly by winter snow. Western
disturbances cause heavy snowfall from December to March over this region (Thayyen and
Gergan 2010). Generally, seasonal melting starts in the month of May and continues till
October (Dobhal, Gergan, and Thayyen 2008).

Data and methods
3.1.
Coherence detection for glacier retreat
InSAR provides avenues to study glaciers in terms of snout and glacial lake monitoring, as
well as ground displacement and topographic variations, using interferograms (Luckman,
Quincey, and Bevan 2007; Kumar et al. 2008; Capps et al. 2010). Glacier monitoring using
InSAR is advancing towards new frontiers; in this study, we develop coherence maps using
SAR image pairs to map the location of the snout of the Gangotri glacier. Previously, this
technique has been utilized to delineate glacier extent (Atwood, Meyer, and Arendt 2010)
and to identify debris-covered portions of glaciers in the northwest Himalayas (Frey, Paul,
and Strozzi 2012). In this study, we utilize the coherency attribute between two SAR images
for snout monitoring. We estimate coherence of interferograms made from two SAR acqui-
sitions with the spatial correlation of the InSAR phase over small areas of pixels (Fielding
et al. 2005). This phase correlation is related to the relative displacement of the scatter-
ing objects within each pixel and large surface motion during the time between two SAR
acquisitions. While higher values of coherence are associated with small motion and disrup-
tion of the surface, lower values are representative of considerable displacement or surface
changes over a speciﬁed time period. Practically, it can help in understanding the stabil-
ity of the terrain imaged. Ice, which is constantly melting and accumulating in addition
to ﬂowing laterally, shows very low relative coherence even if the images have a small
temporal baseline. InSAR coherence estimates typically involve a bias of ∼20% in areas

P. Saraswat et al.
of low coherence, so we consider relative values of coherence instead of the absolute val-
ues in order to characterize the stability of the surface. The terminus, where the ground is
exposed as a consequence of glacier retreat, shows better coherence compared to the pix-
els within the glacier (Atwood, Meyer, and Arendt 2010). To delineate a high coherence
zone, which is ice-free ground, we apply a threshold of 0.4 (40%) to InSAR correlation to
select the areas of high coherence from the interferograms. This is based on the assump-
tion that high coherence values are largely due to the presence of ice-free surface near the
glacier snout. The retreat rate is calculated as the distance measured between the mapped
snout in ﬁrst image pair (in this case 2004–2005) and last image pair (2009–2010) along
the central ﬂow line of the glacier. However, coherence of the non-glaciated portions of
land ahead of the terminus may be subsequently affected by ﬂowing melt water from the
glacier. This shortcoming was surpassed by selecting images during early summer (March–
May) and early winter (October–December) with relatively short acquisition intervals over
the Gangotri region. The coherence analysis is based on InSAR, incorporating data sets
acquired by the advanced synthetic aperture radar (ASAR) instrument mounted on the
Envisat satellite (Image Mode; see Table 1). The orbital models for Envisat used in this
study were obtained from ESA Doris orbits (DOR) and processing was performed with
the JPL/Caltech ROI_pac software (Rosen et al. 2004). Digital elevation model (DEM)
data are required to remove and model topographic phase contributions, and to orthorec-
tify the data for intercomparison. Here, we use NASA’s Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission
(SRTM) (Rodriguez, Morris, and Belz 2006) DEM with voids ﬁlled by other sources, avail-
able from Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) Consortium
for Spatial Information (CGIAR-CSI) (http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/). These void-ﬁlled DEMs
(SRTM CGIAR version 3) are particularly effective for the study area since they are
constructed using topographic maps and information from local topography.
However, at times InSAR fails to produce reliable measurements of ice motion for
fast moving glaciers primarily due to temporal decorrelation or loss of coherence, in the
absence of optimal temporal baseline between the image pairs. This aspect is one of the
major limitations associated with this technique. Further, steep slopes, particularly in the
Gangotri region, inhibit an across-track view of the glacier and render SAR data from the
widely available satellites unreliable for glacier velocity measurements. Due to the absence
of Envisat SAR pairs with short time intervals over the study area (minimum possible

repeat time of Envisat was 35 days, but not every orbit had SAR images acquired), tem-
poral decorrelation is a major issue encountered in this study. For the available pairs, the
glacier motion is large enough to cause incoherent InSAR leading to temporal decorrela-
tion. Hence, the absence of good coherence between subsequent SAR image pairs makes it
difﬁcult to measure the Gangotri ice velocity with Envisat InSAR.
3.2.
Velocity measurements using pixel offset tracking
Mapping the glacier surface velocity is crucial for characterizing ice dynamics and quan-
tifying glacier ice mass balance (Bindschadler and Scambos 1991; Joughin et al. 2002;
Rignot and Thomas 2002). In order to overcome the previously mentioned region-speciﬁc
limitation of InSAR in mapping glacier velocity, we took an alternative approach to monitor
glacier velocities utilizing sub-pixel offset tracking on nadir-viewing near infrared (NIR)
imagery from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reﬂection Radiometer
(ASTER). This technique utilizes cross-correlation between two images to estimate sur-
face velocities, details of which are illustrated in Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008).
Pixel offset tracking or sub-pixel correlation is a technique to measure the motion of spa-
tially coherent features through time between two images (Crippen 1992). In glaciology,
these features generally consist of crevasses, undulations, and moraines (Konig, Winther,
and Isaksson 2001). The horizontal displacement thus obtained can be used to generate
velocity maps utilizing the time difference between the images pairs. In this study, the
ENVI- and IDL-based processing software, Co-registration of Optically Sensed Images
and Correlation (COSI-Corr) (Leprince et al. 2007), is used for the said purpose. This
method has been successfully used for measuring glacier velocities such as those in Stearns,
Hamilton, and Reeh (2005), Howat et al. (2008), Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008),
Debella-Gilo and Kääb (2011), Herman, Anderson, and Leprince (2011), and Willis et al.
(2012). Initially, a DEM is used to generate approximate tie points for the master image,
and we used the same SRTM 3-arcsecond DEM with the voids ﬁlled by the CGIAR group
(Version 3) as described above. Tie points are then subjected to an optimization algo-
rithm in order to generate precise ground control points to orthorectify the master image.
Once the master image is orthorectiﬁed, ensuing slave images are orthorectiﬁed using
the same master image. After successful orthorectiﬁcation and co-registration of image
pairs, a correlation algorithm is then applied by moving the correlation windows across
the prepared images on a regular grid. Distinctive features are tracked between image
pairs and their displacement is calculated to produce displacement maps and their cor-
responding signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) maps. Note that the methodology implemented
here is exactly the same as that presented in Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008)
and is most appropriate for additional details on the methodology and functionality of
COSI-Corr.
In order to overcome the limitation of producing high quality velocity estimates from
InSAR, a sub-pixel correlation or offset tracking technique is employed on ASTER L1A
satellite imagery acquired for the region. Table 2 enlists the details of the ASTER L1A data
set analysed in this study. For better results, maximum care is taken to obtain images with
less snowfall and cloud cover, especially over the Gangotri glacier. In order to analyse the
motion over the entire length of the glacier, we acquired ASTER L1A data for two frames
covering the lower and upper reaches of the Gangotri glacier. Both frames were acquired on
the same date and with the same acquisition parameters but processed separately. Another
associated advantage of ASTER imagery over SAR imagery for such difﬁcult terrain is the

this study are mostly acquired during the month of October, which is the end of the melting
season.

Uncertainty analysis
A number of factors contribute to uncertainties in the coherence-based estimates of glacier
retreat rate, including DEM, orbital, and baseline errors. Errors in velocity estimates
obtained using pixel offset tracking can again be attributed primarily to DEM errors, which
are transferred in the form of orthorectiﬁcation errors to the orthorectiﬁed master image.
The SRTM 3-arcsecond DEM that we used has voids ﬁlled by the CGIAR group (Version
3), so the DEM quality is variable. The voids in SRTM version 2 are extensive in the steep
slopes of the Himalayas. We chose ASTER pairs with the same look angle to minimize the
effects of DEM errors since both images have the same viewing geometry. Kääb (2002)
discussed these anomalies as a ground position error, which is about 3 m for moderately
inclined terrains.
Additionally, uncertainties from resampling and image cross-correlation processes are
generally much smaller than the pixel size of 15 m; hence, matches with uncertainties
greater than one pixel are usually discarded during the processing (Scherler, Leprince, and
Strecker 2008). The cumulative error in velocity estimates is less than 5 m year−1 for the
data sets used in this study. This error is estimated by computing surface velocity for loca-
tions where stable ground is exposed typically near the snout to keep other inﬂuencing
factors such as slope and surface conditions as close to the glacier as possible. Since surface
velocity should be ideally zero in these locations, any value other than zero is approximated
as the error. In order to quantify the error, we concentrated on velocities estimated for an
area in front of the snout (Figure 4(a) (Box 1)), which is observed to be ice-free in all of
the images used in this study. Analysis showed that velocities estimated in this study suffer

from a possible bias (mean) of about 4.2 m year−1 and an error (standard deviation) of
about 2.3 m year−1. The high precision in the observed estimates can be attributed to sev-
eral factors such as (1) low cloud cover in the ASTER images, (2) the scenes are obtained
for the same time period (late summer and fall), which helped to eliminate errors related to
snowfall and changes in solar illumination, and (3) the time span between paired ASTER
images are mostly kept at nearly 1 year, which provides a resolvable time window to derive
glacier surface velocities.

Results
4.1.
Glacier recession from 2004–2010
Shown in Figures 2(a) and (b) are the InSAR coherence maps of the Gangotri glacier region
obtained from image pairs with the shortest possible acquisition intervals in order to locate
the snout of the glacier with improved accuracy. The detail of interferometric pairs chosen
to study short and long-term variations of the Gangotri glacier is shown in Table 1. For the
reasons stated above we present results from coherence mapping for Pair 1 (Figure 2(a)) and
Pair 6 (Figure 2(b)). Thus, it can be observed in Figures 2(a) and (b) that by stretching the
values in the coherence maps, the majority of the region registered low coherence, caused
mainly due to accumulation and ablation of snow and ice and also due to steep slopes.
However, regions near the northern ﬂank of the glacier show high coherence (>40%),
which is attributed to the fact that the snout of the glacier has retreated, exposing boulders
and moraines. Hence, these are the areas which show more relative stability over a consid-
erable period of time (typically a few months). Areas further down the valley are likewise
seasonally snow-free but have considerable vegetation (as evident in ASTER scenes, not
shown), which produces low coherence in the image. Thus, high coherence occurs only in
those areas recently exposed by glacial retreat and not yet covered by signiﬁcant vegetation
growth, i.e. only near the glacier snout.
See Table 3 for the snout positions obtained during the period of Pair 1 (2004–2005),
Pair 5, and Pair 6 (2009–2010). These results correlate very well with the snout posi-
tions reported in a previous study, using ground-based surveys (Kumar et al. 2008). The
colour code used in Figure 2(a) and (b) shows two dominant shades, blue representing low
coherence, which is quite apparent over this region since continuous snowfall and melting,
renders most of the region incoherent. The assumption made here is that the newly exposed
surface material adjacent to the snout of the glacier, deposited by continuous recession
of the terminus, should show coherence values well above 40% and is represented by red
zones near the northern ﬂank of the glacier in Figure 2(a) and (b). The average recession
rate of the Gangotri glacier for the period 2004–2010, based on the distance between the
two snout positions (along the central ﬂow line of the glacier), obtained from the coherence
maps (Table 3), is estimated to be 21.3 ± 3 m year−1.
The recession trend is indirectly linked to the glacier mass balance, which is the net
accumulation and ablation within a year measured as the difference between the amount
of snow accumulated in winter and ice removed by melting in summer. The coherence
maps computed from each of the pairs provide insight into the extent of ice-free surface
observed during the respective time periods. Hence, stacking each of these coherence maps
will highlight the area over which terminus retreat has occurred over the entire period of
2004–2010, yielding a holistic view of the ice-free area cleared by ice over the region cov-
ered by the Gangotri glacier and its tributaries. Figure 3 shows the colour-coded coherence
map obtained by stacking the coherence images from Pairs 1, 5, and 6. This represents

Glacier velocity measurements from 2005–2011
In this study, sub-pixel offset tracking analysis is performed on ASTER pairs, acquired
around the month of October during 2005–2006, 2009–2010, and 2010–2011, that covered
the entire Gangotri glacier in two frames. This enables a recent and periodic assessment of
Gangotri glacier dynamics. Figure 4 represents a cumulative analysis plot of the Gangotri
glacier motion. A Euclidean norm of the displacement measured in the north–south and
east–west direction for Pair 2 and Pair 4 (2009–2010), after mosaicking, is shown in
Figure 4(a). Large magnitudes of velocity are observed over the Gangotri glacier for both

pairs (indicated by bright red colour), with a maximum value of 40 ± 2.3 m year−1 in the
lower glacier (Pair 1) and 70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1 in the upper glacier (Pair 4). Considering
the time difference between the two concerned pairs, the velocity of the Gangotri glacier,
during this period, is estimated to be a maximum of 70.2 m year−1 near the head of the
glacier and less than 30 ± 2.3 m year−1 near the snout of the glacier. It is also evident from
Figure 4(a) that the Gangotri glacier recorded higher motion than the surrounding region of
steep mountain slopes, which had near zero net motion. A clear indication of glacier move-
ment is also apparent from the deﬁnite pattern of motion illustrated in the vector ﬁeld plot
shown in Figure 4(b). Streamlines of velocity vectors (shown in Figure 4(b)) clearly demar-
cate the glacier extent and illustrate the magnitude and direction of glacier ice motion.
In order to demonstrate, in greater detail, velocity variations within the Gangotri
glacier during the span of 2005–2011, glacier surface velocity along the central ﬂow line
of Gangotri (Figure 4(b)) is analysed for each of the images pairs (Table 2). Shown in
Figures 4(c) and (d) is the velocity versus distance curve drawn along the proﬁle line (Line
AB for Pairs 1, 2, and 3 and CD for Pair 4 and 5 in Figure 4(b)). As observed from the pro-
ﬁle plot for the lower reaches of Gangotri (Figure 4(c)), surface velocity variation is almost
similar for all the three pairs. However, the annual ﬂow rate for Pair 1 (2005–2006) is
comparatively lower than that of Pair 2 (2009–2010) and Pair 3 (2010–2011), particu-
larly near the snout and in the lower reaches of the glacier. In general, surface velocity
is larger at higher reaches of the glacier as compared to those near the lower reaches and
is likely dependent on variations in the glacier slope, width, and thickness. This pattern
is also evident from the proﬁle plot for higher reaches of the glacier (Figure 4(d) (also
see supplementary Figure S1 at http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2013.845923), where
the glacier mass velocity is considerably higher near the head of the Gangotri glacier, for
both the image pairs. While surface velocity near the snout, for all the time periods, varied
between 24.8 ± 2.3 to 28.9 ± 2.3 m year−1, velocities away from the snout varied between
a minimum of 13.9 ± 2.3 m year−1 to a maximum of 70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1 (in the upper
reaches of the glacier). The average velocity for the image pairs, 1, 2, and 3, are 28.1 ± 2.3,
27.9 ± 2.3, and 28.2 ± 2.3 m year−1, respectively, which is considerably lower than the
average velocities for Pair 4 and Pair 5, which are 45.7 ± 2.3 and 50.4 ± 2.3 m year−1,
respectively.

Discussion
Glacier surface velocity and retreat rate are two very important parameters that are used to
characterize glacier dynamics. This study has produced reliable estimates of both of these
parameters. The methodology involved the utilization of coherence mapping and image
stacking to locate and monitor snout movement as well as quantify the zone of melting
over a considerable time span. The observed snout positions between 2004 and 2010 are
commensurate with those observed in earlier studies. Gangotri glacier retreat rate observed
in this study is comparable to rates of 23 m year−1 (for 1985–2001) (Hasnain, Ahmad,
and Kumar 2004; Cruz et al. 2007), 17.15 m year−1 (1971–2004) (Raina 2009), 23.2 m
year−1 (for 1968–2001) (Bhambri, Bolch, and Chaujar 2011a, 2011b), and 19.9 m year−1
(for 1965–2006) (Bhambri, Bolch, and Chaujar 2012). The most recent estimate of glacier
retreat using the differential global positioning system (DGPS) and satellite imagery was
obtained to be 17.59 m year−1 for the period of 1976–2009 (Kumar, Areendran, and Rao
2009). Table 4 summarizes some of the most recently published retreat rates of the Gangotri
glacier. The retreat rate measured in this study corroborates well with most of the long-term

measurements, estimated over the past 70 years, which also establishes the efﬁcacy of the
methodology presented here. And perhaps most importantly, the results presented here indi-
cate that the most recent retreat rate of the Gangotri glacier conﬁrms a continuous retreat
of the glacier with a consistent rate taking into consideration multidecadal measurements.
The current study also addresses the phenomenon of temporal decorrelation and associ-
ated limitations of InSAR with longer time intervals for surface velocity measurements
and DEM generation for this particular region of the Eastern Himalayas. Sub-pixel offset
tracking, utilizing ASTER data, enabled high-resolution measurements of surface ice-mass
velocity, which is particularly relevant in difﬁcult mountainous terrains such as that of the
present study area (e.g. Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker 2008). A comprehensive analysis
of surface velocity of the Gangotri glacier is performed for the entire length, from snout to
the head, of the glacier. In general, the observed surface velocity variations of the Gangotri
glacier are comparatively similar for the entire range of image pairs (between 2005 and
2011) acquired for this study. However, the magnitude of glacier motion is typically low
for the period 2005–2006, which was also reported in Raina (2009). While the majority of
the incongruence amongst the spatial distribution of surface velocity is noted in the upper
reaches of the glacier, velocities near the snout are almost similar over all time periods. The
annual variations are high, which indicates fast motion of the Gangotri glacier, especially
during the period 2009–2011. These estimates are considerably higher than the short-term
estimates made by Kumar, Venkataraman, and Hogda (2011), Kumar et al. (2011), and
yearly estimates by Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008). Such high surface velocities
may indicate that ice motion in this region is dominated by basal sliding in the ablation
zone of this relatively steep glacier. The velocities estimated here are based on cumula-
tive surface displacement experienced by the glacier over a period of 1 year. Hence, these
velocity estimates do not reﬂect on its seasonal variation. The surface velocity variations
are most comparable for Pairs 2 and 3. However, on average, surface velocity is observed
to be lower during 2005–2006 compared to 2010–2011. These year-to-year variations can
be attributed to factors such as variations in meteorological conditions (Singh et al. 2006)
and the amount of basal sliding (Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker 2008) over the years.
However, yearly differences in the amount of basal sliding due to the variation in melt
water ﬂux can be a contributory factor.
The current study has the potential to provide an integrated assessment of glacier ﬂow
dynamics, to complement previous and future studies in the area and to provide a key
methodology to delineate glacial lake formation (Quincey et al. 2007; Bolch et al. 2011),
which is of major concern in the Himalayan glaciers.

Conclusions
This study provides comprehensive characterization of the dynamics of the Gangotri glacier
in terms of retreat rate and surface velocity estimates over a continuous period from 2004 to
2010. We employed SAR interferometry to quantify the snout retreat of the Gangotri glacier
in the Himalayas, exploring its capabilities for an integrated assessment of the glacier.
Results showed that the Gangotri glacier, which is one of the largest Himalayan glaciers,
retreated about 119 m over a period of 6 years (2004–2010), at an average rate of 21.3 ± 3 m
year−1. In the context of previous studies, the rate has been almost the same for the last
couple of decades. The results also demonstrated that retreat rate of the terminus was not
uniform over the 6-year period. Further, stacking coherence images from different SAR
pairs delineated the area cleared by ice from 2004 to 2010, facilitating a broader idea about
melting of Gangotri and its tributary glaciers. Results from the sub-pixel offset tracking of
ASTER images revealed signiﬁcant motion along the length of the glacier and its tributaries
compared to the surrounding region, meanwhile establishing a better picture of ﬂow char-
acteristics of the Gangotri glacier. High velocities were observed at the upper reaches of the
glacier while comparatively less movement was observed near the snout. Speciﬁcally, while
the average glacier surface velocity was estimated to be about 36.1 ± 2.3 m year−1, over the
period 2005–2011, the maximum and minimum velocities ranged between 13.9 ± 2.3 and
70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1. Overall, variation of surface velocity of ice mass over the entire length
of the Gangotri glacier was approximately similar for all of the image pairs studied for the
period 2005–2011. While most previous studies suggest a decrease in retreat rate based on
observations made over short time period (e.g. Kumar et al. 2008), our study, which is based
on almost continuous measurements over a period of 6 years, suggests that the glacier is
melting at a constant rate, which is in accordance with long-term estimates measured since
1965. Such observations are useful in assessing the glacier’s response to climate change
and provide an avenue to understand glacier dynamics and its relation to glacier surface
morphology.

Glacier mass variations have a direct impact on some of the key components of the
global water cycle, including sea level rise and freshwater availability. Apart from being
one of the largest Himalayan glaciers, Gangotri is one of the sources of water for the
Ganges river, which has a considerable inﬂuence on the socioeconomic structure of a
largely over-populated catchment area accounting for ∼26% of India’s landmass. In this
study, we present the most recent assessment of the Gangotri glacier dynamics, combin-
ing the use of interferometric techniques on synthetic aperture radar data and sub-pixel
offset tracking on Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reﬂection Radiometer
(ASTER) satellite imagery. Results show that on average, the Gangotri glacier snout
has receded at a rate of 21.3 ± 3 m year−1 over a period of 6 years (2004–2010).
While glacier surface velocity near the snout is estimated to be between 24.8 ± 2.3 and
28.9 ± 2.3 m year−1, interior portions of the glacier recorded velocities in the range of
13.9 ± 2.3 to 70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1. Further, the average glacier surface velocity in the
northern (lower) portions (28.1 ± 2.3 m year−1) is observed to be signiﬁcantly lower
than in the southern (higher) portions (48.1 ± 2.3 m year−1) of the Gangotri glacier.
These values are calculated with an uncertainty of less than 5 m year−1. Results also
highlight a consistent retreat and non-uniform dynamics of the Gangotri glacier.

Introduction
The impact of climate change on glaciers of the world has been a topic of active concern
in recent times (Syed et al. 2007; Bagla 2009; Cogley et al. 2010). While glacial melt is a
major source of freshwater that contributes to global mean sea level rise (Meier et al. 2007;
Jacob et al. 2012), decreasing glacial mass has an impact on the freshwater resources of
some of the largest river basins in the world, including that of the Ganges (e.g. Kumar,
Singh, and Sharma 2005; Mall et al. 2006; Immerzeel, van Beek, and Bierkens 2010;
Kaser, Grosshauser, and Marzeion 2010). Fluctuations in the recession rate of glaciers dur-
ing recent years have initiated widespread discussions, especially in the context of global
warming and its effects (Dyurgerov and Meier 2005). Similar ice mass changes have also
been reported in the Garhwal region of the Himalayas (Kulkarni et al. 2005; Bhambri,
Bolch, and Chaujar 2011a, 2011b; Kulkarni et al. 2011; Bolch et al. 2012). However, the

status of the Gangotri glacier warrants further investigation, particularly in the context of
climate change resulting in continuous retreat, negative mass balance, and early melting of
seasonal snow cover (Negi et al. 2012).
Glaciers cover about 40,800 km2 of the Himalayan and Karakoram mountain region,
and are one of the main sources of water to some of the largest rivers in the world, including
the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Indus (Kulkarni et al. 2011; Bajracharya and Shrestha 2011;
Bolch et al. 2012). Approximately 10% of the summer discharge of the Ganges is attributed
to melt waters from glaciers (Barnett, Adam, and Letternmaier 2005; Jain, Agarwal, and
Singh 2007; Immerzeel, van Beek, and Bierkens 2010; Bolch et al. 2012). Rapid depletion
of glaciers has had adverse effects on the ﬂow regime of major Himalayan rivers, and can
even lead to catastrophic events such as glacial lake outbursts (Govindha 2010; Shrestha,
Eriksson, and Mool 2010; Ashraf, Naz, and Roohi 2012) and consequent ﬂooding in the
upper reaches of these rivers, affecting the lives of millions of people residing in the Indo-
Gangetic plains (Richardson and Reynolds 2000; Bolch et al. 2012).
In spite of their hydrologic, climatic, and socioeconomic signiﬁcance, opportunities for
precise and continuous monitoring of the Himalayan glaciers are limited by logistical and
terrain-induced difﬁculties. Observations of Earth’s surface using satellite data have proven
to be very useful in such monitoring; recent developments in high-resolution image acqui-
sition have facilitated more precise monitoring of glacier movement (Luckman, Quincey,
and Bevan 2007; Kumar, Venkataraman, and Hogda 2011; Kumar et al. 2011). Further,
satellite data enables a gross analysis of glacier mass budgets, overcoming some of the
problems of accessibility and sustainability of long-term measurements, that can later be
veriﬁed with ground-based surveys (Kumar et al. 2008). The potential of remote sensing
for glacier mass balance and velocity mapping has been demonstrated with optical (e.g.
Kääb 2005; Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker 2008), synthetic aperture radar (SAR) (e.g.
Luckman, Quincey, and Bevan 2007), and thermal infrared sensors (e.g. Nakawo, Yabuki,
and Sakai 1999), and elevation models (Bolch, Pieczonka, and Benn 2011), among others.
Developments in deriving ﬂow rates and monitoring Himalayan glacier retreat using optical
images have been made by Kääb (2005). However, this approach is sometimes limited by
weather, clouds, and shadows in areas of high relief.
In a novel approach, the current study presents one of the most comprehensive assess-
ments of the Gangotri glacier in recent times (2004–2011). The methodology entails the
utilization of interferometric SAR (InSAR) coherence and sub-pixel offset tracking. While
complementing most previous studies, the result presented here establishes the effective-
ness of the techniques implemented to produce robust estimates of areal changes and glacier
surface velocity in near real time. But, perhaps most importantly, this is one of the few stud-
ies which has shown the melting trend of Gangotri glacier over a considerably continuous
period during recent times (2004–2011).

Study area
The Gangotri glacier is a valley-type glacier and one of the largest Himalayan glaciers
located in Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand, India (Figure 1). Extending between the lat-
itudes 30◦ 43′ 22′′ N–30◦ 55′ 49′′ N and longitudes 79◦ 4′ 41′′ E–79◦ 16′ 34′′ E, Gangotri
is the only major Himalayan glacier that ﬂows towards the northwest. It spans a length
of 30.2 km, its width varies between 0.20 and 2.35 km, and it thereby covers an area of
about 86.32 km2. While the average thickness of the Gangotri glacier is ∼200 m, its sur-
face elevation varies from 4000 to 7000 m above mean sea level (Jain 2008). Gangotri has
three main tributaries, namely the Raktvarna, the Chaturangi, and the Kirti, with lengths

of 15.90, 22.45, and 11.05 km, respectively (Figure 1). Additionally, there are more than
18 small tributary glaciers of Gangotri and its tributaries. Gangotri and other glaciers in
this region are mostly fed by the summer monsoon and partly by winter snow. Western
disturbances cause heavy snowfall from December to March over this region (Thayyen and
Gergan 2010). Generally, seasonal melting starts in the month of May and continues till
October (Dobhal, Gergan, and Thayyen 2008).

Data and methods
3.1.
Coherence detection for glacier retreat
InSAR provides avenues to study glaciers in terms of snout and glacial lake monitoring, as
well as ground displacement and topographic variations, using interferograms (Luckman,
Quincey, and Bevan 2007; Kumar et al. 2008; Capps et al. 2010). Glacier monitoring using
InSAR is advancing towards new frontiers; in this study, we develop coherence maps using
SAR image pairs to map the location of the snout of the Gangotri glacier. Previously, this
technique has been utilized to delineate glacier extent (Atwood, Meyer, and Arendt 2010)
and to identify debris-covered portions of glaciers in the northwest Himalayas (Frey, Paul,
and Strozzi 2012). In this study, we utilize the coherency attribute between two SAR images
for snout monitoring. We estimate coherence of interferograms made from two SAR acqui-
sitions with the spatial correlation of the InSAR phase over small areas of pixels (Fielding
et al. 2005). This phase correlation is related to the relative displacement of the scatter-
ing objects within each pixel and large surface motion during the time between two SAR
acquisitions. While higher values of coherence are associated with small motion and disrup-
tion of the surface, lower values are representative of considerable displacement or surface
changes over a speciﬁed time period. Practically, it can help in understanding the stabil-
ity of the terrain imaged. Ice, which is constantly melting and accumulating in addition
to ﬂowing laterally, shows very low relative coherence even if the images have a small
temporal baseline. InSAR coherence estimates typically involve a bias of ∼20% in areas

P. Saraswat et al.
of low coherence, so we consider relative values of coherence instead of the absolute val-
ues in order to characterize the stability of the surface. The terminus, where the ground is
exposed as a consequence of glacier retreat, shows better coherence compared to the pix-
els within the glacier (Atwood, Meyer, and Arendt 2010). To delineate a high coherence
zone, which is ice-free ground, we apply a threshold of 0.4 (40%) to InSAR correlation to
select the areas of high coherence from the interferograms. This is based on the assump-
tion that high coherence values are largely due to the presence of ice-free surface near the
glacier snout. The retreat rate is calculated as the distance measured between the mapped
snout in ﬁrst image pair (in this case 2004–2005) and last image pair (2009–2010) along
the central ﬂow line of the glacier. However, coherence of the non-glaciated portions of
land ahead of the terminus may be subsequently affected by ﬂowing melt water from the
glacier. This shortcoming was surpassed by selecting images during early summer (March–
May) and early winter (October–December) with relatively short acquisition intervals over
the Gangotri region. The coherence analysis is based on InSAR, incorporating data sets
acquired by the advanced synthetic aperture radar (ASAR) instrument mounted on the
Envisat satellite (Image Mode; see Table 1). The orbital models for Envisat used in this
study were obtained from ESA Doris orbits (DOR) and processing was performed with
the JPL/Caltech ROI_pac software (Rosen et al. 2004). Digital elevation model (DEM)
data are required to remove and model topographic phase contributions, and to orthorec-
tify the data for intercomparison. Here, we use NASA’s Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission

(SRTM CGIAR version 3) are particularly effective for the study area since they are
constructed using topographic maps and information from local topography.
However, at times InSAR fails to produce reliable measurements of ice motion for
fast moving glaciers primarily due to temporal decorrelation or loss of coherence, in the
absence of optimal temporal baseline between the image pairs. This aspect is one of the
major limitations associated with this technique. Further, steep slopes, particularly in the
Gangotri region, inhibit an across-track view of the glacier and render SAR data from the
widely available satellites unreliable for glacier velocity measurements. Due to the absence
of Envisat SAR pairs with short time intervals over the study area (minimum possible

repeat time of Envisat was 35 days, but not every orbit had SAR images acquired), tem-
poral decorrelation is a major issue encountered in this study. For the available pairs, the
glacier motion is large enough to cause incoherent InSAR leading to temporal decorrela-
tion. Hence, the absence of good coherence between subsequent SAR image pairs makes it
difﬁcult to measure the Gangotri ice velocity with Envisat InSAR.
3.2.
Velocity measurements using pixel offset tracking
Mapping the glacier surface velocity is crucial for characterizing ice dynamics and quan-
tifying glacier ice mass balance (Bindschadler and Scambos 1991; Joughin et al. 2002;
Rignot and Thomas 2002). In order to overcome the previously mentioned region-speciﬁc
limitation of InSAR in mapping glacier velocity, we took an alternative approach to monitor
glacier velocities utilizing sub-pixel offset tracking on nadir-viewing near infrared (NIR)
imagery from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reﬂection Radiometer
(ASTER). This technique utilizes cross-correlation between two images to estimate sur-
face velocities, details of which are illustrated in Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008).
Pixel offset tracking or sub-pixel correlation is a technique to measure the motion of spa-
tially coherent features through time between two images (Crippen 1992). In glaciology,
these features generally consist of crevasses, undulations, and moraines (Konig, Winther,
and Isaksson 2001). The horizontal displacement thus obtained can be used to generate
velocity maps utilizing the time difference between the images pairs. In this study, the
ENVI- and IDL-based processing software, Co-registration of Optically Sensed Images
and Correlation (COSI-Corr) (Leprince et al. 2007), is used for the said purpose. This
method has been successfully used for measuring glacier velocities such as those in Stearns,
Hamilton, and Reeh (2005), Howat et al. (2008), Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008),
Debella-Gilo and Kääb (2011), Herman, Anderson, and Leprince (2011), and Willis et al.
(2012). Initially, a DEM is used to generate approximate tie points for the master image,
and we used the same SRTM 3-arcsecond DEM with the voids ﬁlled by the CGIAR group
(Version 3) as described above. Tie points are then subjected to an optimization algo-
rithm in order to generate precise ground control points to orthorectify the master image.
Once the master image is orthorectiﬁed, ensuing slave images are orthorectiﬁed using
the same master image. After successful orthorectiﬁcation and co-registration of image
pairs, a correlation algorithm is then applied by moving the correlation windows across
the prepared images on a regular grid. Distinctive features are tracked between image
pairs and their displacement is calculated to produce displacement maps and their cor-
responding signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) maps. Note that the methodology implemented
here is exactly the same as that presented in Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008)
and is most appropriate for additional details on the methodology and functionality of
COSI-Corr.
In order to overcome the limitation of producing high quality velocity estimates from
InSAR, a sub-pixel correlation or offset tracking technique is employed on ASTER L1A
satellite imagery acquired for the region. Table 2 enlists the details of the ASTER L1A data
set analysed in this study. For better results, maximum care is taken to obtain images with
less snowfall and cloud cover, especially over the Gangotri glacier. In order to analyse the
motion over the entire length of the glacier, we acquired ASTER L1A data for two frames
covering the lower and upper reaches of the Gangotri glacier. Both frames were acquired on
the same date and with the same acquisition parameters but processed separately. Another
associated advantage of ASTER imagery over SAR imagery for such difﬁcult terrain is the

availability of the 3N (NIR) band with nadir-viewing geometry and 15 m spatial resolution,
thus minimizing topography-induced errors in the velocity estimates. The images used in
this study are mostly acquired during the month of October, which is the end of the melting
season.
3.3.
Uncertainty analysis
A number of factors contribute to uncertainties in the coherence-based estimates of glacier
retreat rate, including DEM, orbital, and baseline errors. Errors in velocity estimates
obtained using pixel offset tracking can again be attributed primarily to DEM errors, which
are transferred in the form of orthorectiﬁcation errors to the orthorectiﬁed master image.
The SRTM 3-arcsecond DEM that we used has voids ﬁlled by the CGIAR group (Version
3), so the DEM quality is variable. The voids in SRTM version 2 are extensive in the steep
slopes of the Himalayas. We chose ASTER pairs with the same look angle to minimize the
effects of DEM errors since both images have the same viewing geometry. Kääb (2002)
discussed these anomalies as a ground position error, which is about 3 m for moderately
inclined terrains.
Additionally, uncertainties from resampling and image cross-correlation processes are
generally much smaller than the pixel size of 15 m; hence, matches with uncertainties
greater than one pixel are usually discarded during the processing (Scherler, Leprince, and
Strecker 2008). The cumulative error in velocity estimates is less than 5 m year−1 for the
data sets used in this study. This error is estimated by computing surface velocity for loca-
tions where stable ground is exposed typically near the snout to keep other inﬂuencing
factors such as slope and surface conditions as close to the glacier as possible. Since surface
velocity should be ideally zero in these locations, any value other than zero is approximated
as the error. In order to quantify the error, we concentrated on velocities estimated for an
area in front of the snout (Figure 4(a) (Box 1)), which is observed to be ice-free in all of
the images used in this study. Analysis showed that velocities estimated in this study suffer

from a possible bias (mean) of about 4.2 m year−1 and an error (standard deviation) of
about 2.3 m year−1. The high precision in the observed estimates can be attributed to sev-
eral factors such as (1) low cloud cover in the ASTER images, (2) the scenes are obtained
for the same time period (late summer and fall), which helped to eliminate errors related to
snowfall and changes in solar illumination, and (3) the time span between paired ASTER
images are mostly kept at nearly 1 year, which provides a resolvable time window to derive
glacier surface velocities.

Results
4.1.
Glacier recession from 2004–2010
Shown in Figures 2(a) and (b) are the InSAR coherence maps of the Gangotri glacier region
obtained from image pairs with the shortest possible acquisition intervals in order to locate
the snout of the glacier with improved accuracy. The detail of interferometric pairs chosen
to study short and long-term variations of the Gangotri glacier is shown in Table 1. For the
reasons stated above we present results from coherence mapping for Pair 1 (Figure 2(a)) and
Pair 6 (Figure 2(b)). Thus, it can be observed in Figures 2(a) and (b) that by stretching the
values in the coherence maps, the majority of the region registered low coherence, caused
mainly due to accumulation and ablation of snow and ice and also due to steep slopes.
However, regions near the northern ﬂank of the glacier show high coherence (>40%),
which is attributed to the fact that the snout of the glacier has retreated, exposing boulders
and moraines. Hence, these are the areas which show more relative stability over a consid-
erable period of time (typically a few months). Areas further down the valley are likewise
seasonally snow-free but have considerable vegetation (as evident in ASTER scenes, not
shown), which produces low coherence in the image. Thus, high coherence occurs only in
those areas recently exposed by glacial retreat and not yet covered by signiﬁcant vegetation
growth, i.e. only near the glacier snout.
See Table 3 for the snout positions obtained during the period of Pair 1 (2004–2005),
Pair 5, and Pair 6 (2009–2010). These results correlate very well with the snout posi-
tions reported in a previous study, using ground-based surveys (Kumar et al. 2008). The
colour code used in Figure 2(a) and (b) shows two dominant shades, blue representing low
coherence, which is quite apparent over this region since continuous snowfall and melting,
renders most of the region incoherent. The assumption made here is that the newly exposed
surface material adjacent to the snout of the glacier, deposited by continuous recession
of the terminus, should show coherence values well above 40% and is represented by red
zones near the northern ﬂank of the glacier in Figure 2(a) and (b). The average recession
rate of the Gangotri glacier for the period 2004–2010, based on the distance between the
two snout positions (along the central ﬂow line of the glacier), obtained from the coherence
maps (Table 3), is estimated to be 21.3 ± 3 m year−1.
The recession trend is indirectly linked to the glacier mass balance, which is the net
accumulation and ablation within a year measured as the difference between the amount
of snow accumulated in winter and ice removed by melting in summer. The coherence
maps computed from each of the pairs provide insight into the extent of ice-free surface
observed during the respective time periods. Hence, stacking each of these coherence maps
will highlight the area over which terminus retreat has occurred over the entire period of
2004–2010, yielding a holistic view of the ice-free area cleared by ice over the region cov-
ered by the Gangotri glacier and its tributaries. Figure 3 shows the colour-coded coherence
map obtained by stacking the coherence images from Pairs 1, 5, and 6. This represents

Glacier velocity measurements from 2005–2011

around the month of October during 2005–2006, 2009–2010, and 2010–2011, that covered
the entire Gangotri glacier in two frames. This enables a recent and periodic assessment of
Gangotri glacier dynamics. Figure 4 represents a cumulative analysis plot of the Gangotri
glacier motion. A Euclidean norm of the displacement measured in the north–south and

pairs (indicated by bright red colour), with a maximum value of 40 ± 2.3 m year−1 in the
lower glacier (Pair 1) and 70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1 in the upper glacier (Pair 4). Considering
the time difference between the two concerned pairs, the velocity of the Gangotri glacier,
during this period, is estimated to be a maximum of 70.2 m year−1 near the head of the
glacier and less than 30 ± 2.3 m year−1 near the snout of the glacier. It is also evident from
Figure 4(a) that the Gangotri glacier recorded higher motion than the surrounding region of
steep mountain slopes, which had near zero net motion. A clear indication of glacier move-
ment is also apparent from the deﬁnite pattern of motion illustrated in the vector ﬁeld plot
shown in Figure 4(b). Streamlines of velocity vectors (shown in Figure 4(b)) clearly demar-
cate the glacier extent and illustrate the magnitude and direction of glacier ice motion.
In order to demonstrate, in greater detail, velocity variations within the Gangotri
glacier during the span of 2005–2011, glacier surface velocity along the central ﬂow line
of Gangotri (Figure 4(b)) is analysed for each of the images pairs (Table 2). Shown in
Figures 4(c) and (d) is the velocity versus distance curve drawn along the proﬁle line (Line
AB for Pairs 1, 2, and 3 and CD for Pair 4 and 5 in Figure 4(b)). As observed from the pro-
ﬁle plot for the lower reaches of Gangotri (Figure 4(c)), surface velocity variation is almost
similar for all the three pairs. However, the annual ﬂow rate for Pair 1 (2005–2006) is
comparatively lower than that of Pair 2 (2009–2010) and Pair 3 (2010–2011), particu-
larly near the snout and in the lower reaches of the glacier. In general, surface velocity
is larger at higher reaches of the glacier as compared to those near the lower reaches and
is likely dependent on variations in the glacier slope, width, and thickness. This pattern
is also evident from the proﬁle plot for higher reaches of the glacier (Figure 4(d) (also
see supplementary Figure S1 at http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2013.845923), where
the glacier mass velocity is considerably higher near the head of the Gangotri glacier, for
both the image pairs. While surface velocity near the snout, for all the time periods, varied
between 24.8 ± 2.3 to 28.9 ± 2.3 m year−1, velocities away from the snout varied between
a minimum of 13.9 ± 2.3 m year−1 to a maximum of 70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1 (in the upper
reaches of the glacier). The average velocity for the image pairs, 1, 2, and 3, are 28.1 ± 2.3,
27.9 ± 2.3, and 28.2 ± 2.3 m year−1, respectively, which is considerably lower than the
average velocities for Pair 4 and Pair 5, which are 45.7 ± 2.3 and 50.4 ± 2.3 m year−1,
respectively.

Discussion
Glacier surface velocity and retreat rate are two very important parameters that are used to
characterize glacier dynamics. This study has produced reliable estimates of both of these
parameters. The methodology involved the utilization of coherence mapping and image
stacking to locate and monitor snout movement as well as quantify the zone of melting
over a considerable time span. The observed snout positions between 2004 and 2010 are
commensurate with those observed in earlier studies. Gangotri glacier retreat rate observed
in this study is comparable to rates of 23 m year−1 (for 1985–2001) (Hasnain, Ahmad,
and Kumar 2004; Cruz et al. 2007), 17.15 m year−1 (1971–2004) (Raina 2009), 23.2 m
year−1 (for 1968–2001) (Bhambri, Bolch, and Chaujar 2011a, 2011b), and 19.9 m year−1
(for 1965–2006) (Bhambri, Bolch, and Chaujar 2012). The most recent estimate of glacier
retreat using the differential global positioning system (DGPS) and satellite imagery was
obtained to be 17.59 m year−1 for the period of 1976–2009 (Kumar, Areendran, and Rao
2009). Table 4 summarizes some of the most recently published retreat rates of the Gangotri
glacier. The retreat rate measured in this study corroborates well with most of the long-term

measurements, estimated over the past 70 years, which also establishes the efﬁcacy of the
methodology presented here. And perhaps most importantly, the results presented here indi-
cate that the most recent retreat rate of the Gangotri glacier conﬁrms a continuous retreat
of the glacier with a consistent rate taking into consideration multidecadal measurements.
The current study also addresses the phenomenon of temporal decorrelation and associ-
ated limitations of InSAR with longer time intervals for surface velocity measurements
and DEM generation for this particular region of the Eastern Himalayas. Sub-pixel offset
tracking, utilizing ASTER data, enabled high-resolution measurements of surface ice-mass
velocity, which is particularly relevant in difﬁcult mountainous terrains such as that of the
present study area (e.g. Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker 2008). A comprehensive analysis
of surface velocity of the Gangotri glacier is performed for the entire length, from snout to
the head, of the glacier. In general, the observed surface velocity variations of the Gangotri
glacier are comparatively similar for the entire range of image pairs (between 2005 and
2011) acquired for this study. However, the magnitude of glacier motion is typically low
for the period 2005–2006, which was also reported in Raina (2009). While the majority of
the incongruence amongst the spatial distribution of surface velocity is noted in the upper
reaches of the glacier, velocities near the snout are almost similar over all time periods. The
annual variations are high, which indicates fast motion of the Gangotri glacier, especially
during the period 2009–2011. These estimates are considerably higher than the short-term
estimates made by Kumar, Venkataraman, and Hogda (2011), Kumar et al. (2011), and
yearly estimates by Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008). Such high surface velocities
may indicate that ice motion in this region is dominated by basal sliding in the ablation
zone of this relatively steep glacier. The velocities estimated here are based on cumula-
tive surface displacement experienced by the glacier over a period of 1 year. Hence, these
velocity estimates do not reﬂect on its seasonal variation. The surface velocity variations
are most comparable for Pairs 2 and 3. However, on average, surface velocity is observed
to be lower during 2005–2006 compared to 2010–2011. These year-to-year variations can
be attributed to factors such as variations in meteorological conditions (Singh et al. 2006)
and the amount of basal sliding (Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker 2008) over the years.
However, yearly differences in the amount of basal sliding due to the variation in melt
water ﬂux can be a contributory factor.
The current study has the potential to provide an integrated assessment of glacier ﬂow
dynamics, to complement previous and future studies in the area and to provide a key
methodology to delineate glacial lake formation (Quincey et al. 2007; Bolch et al. 2011),
which is of major concern in the Himalayan glaciers.

Conclusions
This study provides comprehensive characterization of the dynamics of the Gangotri glacier
in terms of retreat rate and surface velocity estimates over a continuous period from 2004 to
2010. We employed SAR interferometry to quantify the snout retreat of the Gangotri glacier
in the Himalayas, exploring its capabilities for an integrated assessment of the glacier.
Results showed that the Gangotri glacier, which is one of the largest Himalayan glaciers,
retreated about 119 m over a period of 6 years (2004–2010), at an average rate of 21.3 ± 3 m
year−1. In the context of previous studies, the rate has been almost the same for the last
couple of decades. The results also demonstrated that retreat rate of the terminus was not
uniform over the 6-year period. Further, stacking coherence images from different SAR
pairs delineated the area cleared by ice from 2004 to 2010, facilitating a broader idea about
melting of Gangotri and its tributary glaciers. Results from the sub-pixel offset tracking of
ASTER images revealed signiﬁcant motion along the length of the glacier and its tributaries
compared to the surrounding region, meanwhile establishing a better picture of ﬂow char-
acteristics of the Gangotri glacier. High velocities were observed at the upper reaches of the
glacier while comparatively less movement was observed near the snout. Speciﬁcally, while
the average glacier surface velocity was estimated to be about 36.1 ± 2.3 m year−1, over the
period 2005–2011, the maximum and minimum velocities ranged between 13.9 ± 2.3 and
70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1. Overall, variation of surface velocity of ice mass over the entire length
of the Gangotri glacier was approximately similar for all of the image pairs studied for the
period 2005–2011. While most previous studies suggest a decrease in retreat rate based on
observations made over short time period (e.g. Kumar et al. 2008), our study, which is based
on almost continuous measurements over a period of 6 years, suggests that the glacier is
melting at a constant rate, which is in accordance with long-term estimates measured since
1965. Such observations are useful in assessing the glacier’s response to climate change
and provide an avenue to understand glacier dynamics and its relation to glacier surface
morphology.

(Received 19 October 2012; accepted 2 September 2013)
Glacier mass variations have a direct impact on some of the key components of the
global water cycle, including sea level rise and freshwater availability. Apart from being
one of the largest Himalayan glaciers, Gangotri is one of the sources of water for the
Ganges river, which has a considerable inﬂuence on the socioeconomic structure of a
largely over-populated catchment area accounting for ∼26% of India’s landmass. In this
study, we present the most recent assessment of the Gangotri glacier dynamics, combin-
ing the use of interferometric techniques on synthetic aperture radar data and sub-pixel
offset tracking on Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reﬂection Radiometer
(ASTER) satellite imagery. Results show that on average, the Gangotri glacier snout
has receded at a rate of 21.3 ± 3 m year−1 over a period of 6 years (2004–2010).
While glacier surface velocity near the snout is estimated to be between 24.8 ± 2.3 and
28.9 ± 2.3 m year−1, interior portions of the glacier recorded velocities in the range of
13.9 ± 2.3 to 70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1. Further, the average glacier surface velocity in the
northern (lower) portions (28.1 ± 2.3 m year−1) is observed to be signiﬁcantly lower
than in the southern (higher) portions (48.1 ± 2.3 m year−1) of the Gangotri glacier.
These values are calculated with an uncertainty of less than 5 m year−1. Results also
highlight a consistent retreat and non-uniform dynamics of the Gangotri glacier.

Introduction
The impact of climate change on glaciers of the world has been a topic of active concern
in recent times (Syed et al. 2007; Bagla 2009; Cogley et al. 2010). While glacial melt is a
major source of freshwater that contributes to global mean sea level rise (Meier et al. 2007;
Jacob et al. 2012), decreasing glacial mass has an impact on the freshwater resources of
some of the largest river basins in the world, including that of the Ganges (e.g. Kumar,
Singh, and Sharma 2005; Mall et al. 2006; Immerzeel, van Beek, and Bierkens 2010;
Kaser, Grosshauser, and Marzeion 2010). Fluctuations in the recession rate of glaciers dur-
ing recent years have initiated widespread discussions, especially in the context of global
warming and its effects (Dyurgerov and Meier 2005). Similar ice mass changes have also
been reported in the Garhwal region of the Himalayas (Kulkarni et al. 2005; Bhambri,
Bolch, and Chaujar 2011a, 2011b; Kulkarni et al. 2011; Bolch et al. 2012). However, the

status of the Gangotri glacier warrants further investigation, particularly in the context of
climate change resulting in continuous retreat, negative mass balance, and early melting of
seasonal snow cover (Negi et al. 2012).
Glaciers cover about 40,800 km2 of the Himalayan and Karakoram mountain region,
and are one of the main sources of water to some of the largest rivers in the world, including
the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Indus (Kulkarni et al. 2011; Bajracharya and Shrestha 2011;
Bolch et al. 2012). Approximately 10% of the summer discharge of the Ganges is attributed
to melt waters from glaciers (Barnett, Adam, and Letternmaier 2005; Jain, Agarwal, and
Singh 2007; Immerzeel, van Beek, and Bierkens 2010; Bolch et al. 2012). Rapid depletion
of glaciers has had adverse effects on the ﬂow regime of major Himalayan rivers, and can
even lead to catastrophic events such as glacial lake outbursts (Govindha 2010; Shrestha,
Eriksson, and Mool 2010; Ashraf, Naz, and Roohi 2012) and consequent ﬂooding in the
upper reaches of these rivers, affecting the lives of millions of people residing in the Indo-
Gangetic plains (Richardson and Reynolds 2000; Bolch et al. 2012).
In spite of their hydrologic, climatic, and socioeconomic signiﬁcance, opportunities for
precise and continuous monitoring of the Himalayan glaciers are limited by logistical and
terrain-induced difﬁculties. Observations of Earth’s surface using satellite data have proven
to be very useful in such monitoring; recent developments in high-resolution image acqui-
sition have facilitated more precise monitoring of glacier movement (Luckman, Quincey,
and Bevan 2007; Kumar, Venkataraman, and Hogda 2011; Kumar et al. 2011). Further,
satellite data enables a gross analysis of glacier mass budgets, overcoming some of the
problems of accessibility and sustainability of long-term measurements, that can later be
veriﬁed with ground-based surveys (Kumar et al. 2008). The potential of remote sensing
for glacier mass balance and velocity mapping has been demonstrated with optical (e.g.
Kääb 2005; Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker 2008), synthetic aperture radar (SAR) (e.g.
Luckman, Quincey, and Bevan 2007), and thermal infrared sensors (e.g. Nakawo, Yabuki,
and Sakai 1999), and elevation models (Bolch, Pieczonka, and Benn 2011), among others.
Developments in deriving ﬂow rates and monitoring Himalayan glacier retreat using optical
images have been made by Kääb (2005). However, this approach is sometimes limited by
weather, clouds, and shadows in areas of high relief.
In a novel approach, the current study presents one of the most comprehensive assess-
ments of the Gangotri glacier in recent times (2004–2011). The methodology entails the
utilization of interferometric SAR (InSAR) coherence and sub-pixel offset tracking. While
complementing most previous studies, the result presented here establishes the effective-
ness of the techniques implemented to produce robust estimates of areal changes and glacier
surface velocity in near real time. But, perhaps most importantly, this is one of the few stud-
ies which has shown the melting trend of Gangotri glacier over a considerably continuous
period during recent times (2004–2011).

Study area
The Gangotri glacier is a valley-type glacier and one of the largest Himalayan glaciers
located in Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand, India (Figure 1). Extending between the lat-
itudes 30◦ 43′ 22′′ N–30◦ 55′ 49′′ N and longitudes 79◦ 4′ 41′′ E–79◦ 16′ 34′′ E, Gangotri
is the only major Himalayan glacier that ﬂows towards the northwest. It spans a length
of 30.2 km, its width varies between 0.20 and 2.35 km, and it thereby covers an area of
about 86.32 km2. While the average thickness of the Gangotri glacier is ∼200 m, its sur-
face elevation varies from 4000 to 7000 m above mean sea level (Jain 2008). Gangotri has
three main tributaries, namely the Raktvarna, the Chaturangi, and the Kirti, with lengths

of 15.90, 22.45, and 11.05 km, respectively (Figure 1). Additionally, there are more than
18 small tributary glaciers of Gangotri and its tributaries. Gangotri and other glaciers in
this region are mostly fed by the summer monsoon and partly by winter snow. Western
disturbances cause heavy snowfall from December to March over this region (Thayyen and
Gergan 2010). Generally, seasonal melting starts in the month of May and continues till
October (Dobhal, Gergan, and Thayyen 2008).

Data and methods
3.1.
Coherence detection for glacier retreat
InSAR provides avenues to study glaciers in terms of snout and glacial lake monitoring, as
well as ground displacement and topographic variations, using interferograms (Luckman,
Quincey, and Bevan 2007; Kumar et al. 2008; Capps et al. 2010). Glacier monitoring using
InSAR is advancing towards new frontiers; in this study, we develop coherence maps using
SAR image pairs to map the location of the snout of the Gangotri glacier. Previously, this
technique has been utilized to delineate glacier extent (Atwood, Meyer, and Arendt 2010)
and to identify debris-covered portions of glaciers in the northwest Himalayas (Frey, Paul,
and Strozzi 2012). In this study, we utilize the coherency attribute between two SAR images
for snout monitoring. We estimate coherence of interferograms made from two SAR acqui-
sitions with the spatial correlation of the InSAR phase over small areas of pixels (Fielding
et al. 2005). This phase correlation is related to the relative displacement of the scatter-
ing objects within each pixel and large surface motion during the time between two SAR
acquisitions. While higher values of coherence are associated with small motion and disrup-
tion of the surface, lower values are representative of considerable displacement or surface
changes over a speciﬁed time period. Practically, it can help in understanding the stabil-
ity of the terrain imaged. Ice, which is constantly melting and accumulating in addition
to ﬂowing laterally, shows very low relative coherence even if the images have a small
temporal baseline. InSAR coherence estimates typically involve a bias of ∼20% in areas

P. Saraswat et al.
of low coherence, so we consider relative values of coherence instead of the absolute val-
ues in order to characterize the stability of the surface. The terminus, where the ground is
exposed as a consequence of glacier retreat, shows better coherence compared to the pix-
els within the glacier (Atwood, Meyer, and Arendt 2010). To delineate a high coherence
zone, which is ice-free ground, we apply a threshold of 0.4 (40%) to InSAR correlation to
select the areas of high coherence from the interferograms. This is based on the assump-
tion that high coherence values are largely due to the presence of ice-free surface near the
glacier snout. The retreat rate is calculated as the distance measured between the mapped
snout in ﬁrst image pair (in this case 2004–2005) and last image pair (2009–2010) along
the central ﬂow line of the glacier. However, coherence of the non-glaciated portions of
land ahead of the terminus may be subsequently affected by ﬂowing melt water from the
glacier. This shortcoming was surpassed by selecting images during early summer (March–
May) and early winter (October–December) with relatively short acquisition intervals over
the Gangotri region. The coherence analysis is based on InSAR, incorporating data sets
acquired by the advanced synthetic aperture radar (ASAR) instrument mounted on the
Envisat satellite (Image Mode; see Table 1). The orbital models for Envisat used in this
study were obtained from ESA Doris orbits (DOR) and processing was performed with
the JPL/Caltech ROI_pac software (Rosen et al. 2004). Digital elevation model (DEM)
data are required to remove and model topographic phase contributions, and to orthorec-
tify the data for intercomparison. Here, we use NASA’s Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission
(SRTM) (Rodriguez, Morris, and Belz 2006) DEM with voids ﬁlled by other sources, avail-
able from Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) Consortium
for Spatial Information (CGIAR-CSI) (http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/). These void-ﬁlled DEMs
(SRTM CGIAR version 3) are particularly effective for the study area since they are
constructed using topographic maps and information from local topography.
However, at times InSAR fails to produce reliable measurements of ice motion for
fast moving glaciers primarily due to temporal decorrelation or loss of coherence, in the
absence of optimal temporal baseline between the image pairs. This aspect is one of the
major limitations associated with this technique. Further, steep slopes, particularly in the
Gangotri region, inhibit an across-track view of the glacier and render SAR data from the
widely available satellites unreliable for glacier velocity measurements. Due to the absence
of Envisat SAR pairs with short time intervals over the study area (minimum possible

repeat time of Envisat was 35 days, but not every orbit had SAR images acquired), tem-
poral decorrelation is a major issue encountered in this study. For the available pairs, the
glacier motion is large enough to cause incoherent InSAR leading to temporal decorrela-
tion. Hence, the absence of good coherence between subsequent SAR image pairs makes it
difﬁcult to measure the Gangotri ice velocity with Envisat InSAR.
3.2.
Velocity measurements using pixel offset tracking
Mapping the glacier surface velocity is crucial for characterizing ice dynamics and quan-
tifying glacier ice mass balance (Bindschadler and Scambos 1991; Joughin et al. 2002;
Rignot and Thomas 2002). In order to overcome the previously mentioned region-speciﬁc
limitation of InSAR in mapping glacier velocity, we took an alternative approach to monitor
glacier velocities utilizing sub-pixel offset tracking on nadir-viewing near infrared (NIR)
imagery from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reﬂection Radiometer
(ASTER). This technique utilizes cross-correlation between two images to estimate sur-
face velocities, details of which are illustrated in Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008).
Pixel offset tracking or sub-pixel correlation is a technique to measure the motion of spa-
tially coherent features through time between two images (Crippen 1992). In glaciology,
these features generally consist of crevasses, undulations, and moraines (Konig, Winther,
and Isaksson 2001). The horizontal displacement thus obtained can be used to generate
velocity maps utilizing the time difference between the images pairs. In this study, the
ENVI- and IDL-based processing software, Co-registration of Optically Sensed Images
and Correlation (COSI-Corr) (Leprince et al. 2007), is used for the said purpose. This
method has been successfully used for measuring glacier velocities such as those in Stearns,
Hamilton, and Reeh (2005), Howat et al. (2008), Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008),
Debella-Gilo and Kääb (2011), Herman, Anderson, and Leprince (2011), and Willis et al.
(2012). Initially, a DEM is used to generate approximate tie points for the master image,
and we used the same SRTM 3-arcsecond DEM with the voids ﬁlled by the CGIAR group
(Version 3) as described above. Tie points are then subjected to an optimization algo-
rithm in order to generate precise ground control points to orthorectify the master image.
Once the master image is orthorectiﬁed, ensuing slave images are orthorectiﬁed using
the same master image. After successful orthorectiﬁcation and co-registration of image
pairs, a correlation algorithm is then applied by moving the correlation windows across
the prepared images on a regular grid. Distinctive features are tracked between image
pairs and their displacement is calculated to produce displacement maps and their cor-
responding signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) maps. Note that the methodology implemented
here is exactly the same as that presented in Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008)
and is most appropriate for additional details on the methodology and functionality of
COSI-Corr.
In order to overcome the limitation of producing high quality velocity estimates from
InSAR, a sub-pixel correlation or offset tracking technique is employed on ASTER L1A
satellite imagery acquired for the region. Table 2 enlists the details of the ASTER L1A data
set analysed in this study. For better results, maximum care is taken to obtain images with
less snowfall and cloud cover, especially over the Gangotri glacier. In order to analyse the
motion over the entire length of the glacier, we acquired ASTER L1A data for two frames
covering the lower and upper reaches of the Gangotri glacier. Both frames were acquired on
the same date and with the same acquisition parameters but processed separately. Another
associated advantage of ASTER imagery over SAR imagery for such difﬁcult terrain is the

availability of the 3N (NIR) band with nadir-viewing geometry and 15 m spatial resolution,
thus minimizing topography-induced errors in the velocity estimates. The images used in
this study are mostly acquired during the month of October, which is the end of the melting
season.
3.3.
Uncertainty analysis
A number of factors contribute to uncertainties in the coherence-based estimates of glacier
retreat rate, including DEM, orbital, and baseline errors. Errors in velocity estimates
obtained using pixel offset tracking can again be attributed primarily to DEM errors, which
are transferred in the form of orthorectiﬁcation errors to the orthorectiﬁed master image.
The SRTM 3-arcsecond DEM that we used has voids ﬁlled by the CGIAR group (Version
3), so the DEM quality is variable. The voids in SRTM version 2 are extensive in the steep
slopes of the Himalayas. We chose ASTER pairs with the same look angle to minimize the
effects of DEM errors since both images have the same viewing geometry. Kääb (2002)
discussed these anomalies as a ground position error, which is about 3 m for moderately
inclined terrains.
Additionally, uncertainties from resampling and image cross-correlation processes are
generally much smaller than the pixel size of 15 m; hence, matches with uncertainties
greater than one pixel are usually discarded during the processing (Scherler, Leprince, and
Strecker 2008). The cumulative error in velocity estimates is less than 5 m year−1 for the
data sets used in this study. This error is estimated by computing surface velocity for loca-
tions where stable ground is exposed typically near the snout to keep other inﬂuencing
factors such as slope and surface conditions as close to the glacier as possible. Since surface
velocity should be ideally zero in these locations, any value other than zero is approximated
as the error. In order to quantify the error, we concentrated on velocities estimated for an
area in front of the snout (Figure 4(a) (Box 1)), which is observed to be ice-free in all of
the images used in this study. Analysis showed that velocities estimated in this study suffer

8659
from a possible bias (mean) of about 4.2 m year−1 and an error (standard deviation) of
about 2.3 m year−1. The high precision in the observed estimates can be attributed to sev-
eral factors such as (1) low cloud cover in the ASTER images, (2) the scenes are obtained
for the same time period (late summer and fall), which helped to eliminate errors related to
snowfall and changes in solar illumination, and (3) the time span between paired ASTER
images are mostly kept at nearly 1 year, which provides a resolvable time window to derive
glacier surface velocities.

Results
4.1.
Glacier recession from 2004–2010
Shown in Figures 2(a) and (b) are the InSAR coherence maps of the Gangotri glacier region
obtained from image pairs with the shortest possible acquisition intervals in order to locate
the snout of the glacier with improved accuracy. The detail of interferometric pairs chosen
to study short and long-term variations of the Gangotri glacier is shown in Table 1. For the
reasons stated above we present results from coherence mapping for Pair 1 (Figure 2(a)) and
Pair 6 (Figure 2(b)). Thus, it can be observed in Figures 2(a) and (b) that by stretching the
values in the coherence maps, the majority of the region registered low coherence, caused
mainly due to accumulation and ablation of snow and ice and also due to steep slopes.
However, regions near the northern ﬂank of the glacier show high coherence (>40%),
which is attributed to the fact that the snout of the glacier has retreated, exposing boulders
and moraines. Hence, these are the areas which show more relative stability over a consid-
erable period of time (typically a few months). Areas further down the valley are likewise
seasonally snow-free but have considerable vegetation (as evident in ASTER scenes, not
shown), which produces low coherence in the image. Thus, high coherence occurs only in
those areas recently exposed by glacial retreat and not yet covered by signiﬁcant vegetation
growth, i.e. only near the glacier snout.
See Table 3 for the snout positions obtained during the period of Pair 1 (2004–2005),
Pair 5, and Pair 6 (2009–2010). These results correlate very well with the snout posi-
tions reported in a previous study, using ground-based surveys (Kumar et al. 2008). The
colour code used in Figure 2(a) and (b) shows two dominant shades, blue representing low
coherence, which is quite apparent over this region since continuous snowfall and melting,
renders most of the region incoherent. The assumption made here is that the newly exposed
surface material adjacent to the snout of the glacier, deposited by continuous recession
of the terminus, should show coherence values well above 40% and is represented by red
zones near the northern ﬂank of the glacier in Figure 2(a) and (b). The average recession
rate of the Gangotri glacier for the period 2004–2010, based on the distance between the
two snout positions (along the central ﬂow line of the glacier), obtained from the coherence
maps (Table 3), is estimated to be 21.3 ± 3 m year−1.
The recession trend is indirectly linked to the glacier mass balance, which is the net
accumulation and ablation within a year measured as the difference between the amount
of snow accumulated in winter and ice removed by melting in summer. The coherence
maps computed from each of the pairs provide insight into the extent of ice-free surface
observed during the respective time periods. Hence, stacking each of these coherence maps
will highlight the area over which terminus retreat has occurred over the entire period of
2004–2010, yielding a holistic view of the ice-free area cleared by ice over the region cov-
ered by the Gangotri glacier and its tributaries. Figure 3 shows the colour-coded coherence
map obtained by stacking the coherence images from Pairs 1, 5, and 6. This represents

Glacier velocity measurements from 2005–2011
In this study, sub-pixel offset tracking analysis is performed on ASTER pairs, acquired
around the month of October during 2005–2006, 2009–2010, and 2010–2011, that covered
the entire Gangotri glacier in two frames. This enables a recent and periodic assessment of
Gangotri glacier dynamics. Figure 4 represents a cumulative analysis plot of the Gangotri
glacier motion. A Euclidean norm of the displacement measured in the north–south and
east–west direction for Pair 2 and Pair 4 (2009–2010), after mosaicking, is shown in

pairs (indicated by bright red colour), with a maximum value of 40 ± 2.3 m year−1 in the
lower glacier (Pair 1) and 70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1 in the upper glacier (Pair 4). Considering
the time difference between the two concerned pairs, the velocity of the Gangotri glacier,
during this period, is estimated to be a maximum of 70.2 m year−1 near the head of the
glacier and less than 30 ± 2.3 m year−1 near the snout of the glacier. It is also evident from
Figure 4(a) that the Gangotri glacier recorded higher motion than the surrounding region of
steep mountain slopes, which had near zero net motion. A clear indication of glacier move-
ment is also apparent from the deﬁnite pattern of motion illustrated in the vector ﬁeld plot
shown in Figure 4(b). Streamlines of velocity vectors (shown in Figure 4(b)) clearly demar-
cate the glacier extent and illustrate the magnitude and direction of glacier ice motion.
In order to demonstrate, in greater detail, velocity variations within the Gangotri
glacier during the span of 2005–2011, glacier surface velocity along the central ﬂow line
of Gangotri (Figure 4(b)) is analysed for each of the images pairs (Table 2). Shown in
Figures 4(c) and (d) is the velocity versus distance curve drawn along the proﬁle line (Line
AB for Pairs 1, 2, and 3 and CD for Pair 4 and 5 in Figure 4(b)). As observed from the pro-
ﬁle plot for the lower reaches of Gangotri (Figure 4(c)), surface velocity variation is almost
similar for all the three pairs. However, the annual ﬂow rate for Pair 1 (2005–2006) is
comparatively lower than that of Pair 2 (2009–2010) and Pair 3 (2010–2011), particu-
larly near the snout and in the lower reaches of the glacier. In general, surface velocity
is larger at higher reaches of the glacier as compared to those near the lower reaches and
is likely dependent on variations in the glacier slope, width, and thickness. This pattern
is also evident from the proﬁle plot for higher reaches of the glacier (Figure 4(d) (also
see supplementary Figure S1 at http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2013.845923), where
the glacier mass velocity is considerably higher near the head of the Gangotri glacier, for
both the image pairs. While surface velocity near the snout, for all the time periods, varied
between 24.8 ± 2.3 to 28.9 ± 2.3 m year−1, velocities away from the snout varied between
a minimum of 13.9 ± 2.3 m year−1 to a maximum of 70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1 (in the upper
reaches of the glacier). The average velocity for the image pairs, 1, 2, and 3, are 28.1 ± 2.3,
27.9 ± 2.3, and 28.2 ± 2.3 m year−1, respectively, which is considerably lower than the
average velocities for Pair 4 and Pair 5, which are 45.7 ± 2.3 and 50.4 ± 2.3 m year−1,
respectively.

Discussion
Glacier surface velocity and retreat rate are two very important parameters that are used to
characterize glacier dynamics. This study has produced reliable estimates of both of these
parameters. The methodology involved the utilization of coherence mapping and image
stacking to locate and monitor snout movement as well as quantify the zone of melting
over a considerable time span. The observed snout positions between 2004 and 2010 are
commensurate with those observed in earlier studies. Gangotri glacier retreat rate observed
in this study is comparable to rates of 23 m year−1 (for 1985–2001) (Hasnain, Ahmad,
and Kumar 2004; Cruz et al. 2007), 17.15 m year−1 (1971–2004) (Raina 2009), 23.2 m
year−1 (for 1968–2001) (Bhambri, Bolch, and Chaujar 2011a, 2011b), and 19.9 m year−1
(for 1965–2006) (Bhambri, Bolch, and Chaujar 2012). The most recent estimate of glacier
retreat using the differential global positioning system (DGPS) and satellite imagery was
obtained to be 17.59 m year−1 for the period of 1976–2009 (Kumar, Areendran, and Rao
2009). Table 4 summarizes some of the most recently published retreat rates of the Gangotri
glacier. The retreat rate measured in this study corroborates well with most of the long-term

measurements, estimated over the past 70 years, which also establishes the efﬁcacy of the
methodology presented here. And perhaps most importantly, the results presented here indi-
cate that the most recent retreat rate of the Gangotri glacier conﬁrms a continuous retreat
of the glacier with a consistent rate taking into consideration multidecadal measurements.
The current study also addresses the phenomenon of temporal decorrelation and associ-
ated limitations of InSAR with longer time intervals for surface velocity measurements
and DEM generation for this particular region of the Eastern Himalayas. Sub-pixel offset
tracking, utilizing ASTER data, enabled high-resolution measurements of surface ice-mass
velocity, which is particularly relevant in difﬁcult mountainous terrains such as that of the
present study area (e.g. Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker 2008). A comprehensive analysis
of surface velocity of the Gangotri glacier is performed for the entire length, from snout to
the head, of the glacier. In general, the observed surface velocity variations of the Gangotri
glacier are comparatively similar for the entire range of image pairs (between 2005 and
2011) acquired for this study. However, the magnitude of glacier motion is typically low
for the period 2005–2006, which was also reported in Raina (2009). While the majority of
the incongruence amongst the spatial distribution of surface velocity is noted in the upper
reaches of the glacier, velocities near the snout are almost similar over all time periods. The
annual variations are high, which indicates fast motion of the Gangotri glacier, especially
during the period 2009–2011. These estimates are considerably higher than the short-term
estimates made by Kumar, Venkataraman, and Hogda (2011), Kumar et al. (2011), and
yearly estimates by Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008). Such high surface velocities
may indicate that ice motion in this region is dominated by basal sliding in the ablation
zone of this relatively steep glacier. The velocities estimated here are based on cumula-
tive surface displacement experienced by the glacier over a period of 1 year. Hence, these
velocity estimates do not reﬂect on its seasonal variation. The surface velocity variations
are most comparable for Pairs 2 and 3. However, on average, surface velocity is observed
to be lower during 2005–2006 compared to 2010–2011. These year-to-year variations can
be attributed to factors such as variations in meteorological conditions (Singh et al. 2006)
and the amount of basal sliding (Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker 2008) over the years.
However, yearly differences in the amount of basal sliding due to the variation in melt
water ﬂux can be a contributory factor.
The current study has the potential to provide an integrated assessment of glacier ﬂow
dynamics, to complement previous and future studies in the area and to provide a key
methodology to delineate glacial lake formation (Quincey et al. 2007; Bolch et al. 2011),
which is of major concern in the Himalayan glaciers.

Conclusions
This study provides comprehensive characterization of the dynamics of the Gangotri glacier
in terms of retreat rate and surface velocity estimates over a continuous period from 2004 to
2010. We employed SAR interferometry to quantify the snout retreat of the Gangotri glacier
in the Himalayas, exploring its capabilities for an integrated assessment of the glacier.
Results showed that the Gangotri glacier, which is one of the largest Himalayan glaciers,
retreated about 119 m over a period of 6 years (2004–2010), at an average rate of 21.3 ± 3 m
year−1. In the context of previous studies, the rate has been almost the same for the last
couple of decades. The results also demonstrated that retreat rate of the terminus was not
uniform over the 6-year period. Further, stacking coherence images from different SAR
pairs delineated the area cleared by ice from 2004 to 2010, facilitating a broader idea about
melting of Gangotri and its tributary glaciers. Results from the sub-pixel offset tracking of
ASTER images revealed signiﬁcant motion along the length of the glacier and its tributaries
compared to the surrounding region, meanwhile establishing a better picture of ﬂow char-
acteristics of the Gangotri glacier. High velocities were observed at the upper reaches of the
glacier while comparatively less movement was observed near the snout. Speciﬁcally, while
the average glacier surface velocity was estimated to be about 36.1 ± 2.3 m year−1, over the
period 2005–2011, the maximum and minimum velocities ranged between 13.9 ± 2.3 and
70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1. Overall, variation of surface velocity of ice mass over the entire length
of the Gangotri glacier was approximately similar for all of the image pairs studied for the
period 2005–2011. While most previous studies suggest a decrease in retreat rate based on
observations made over short time period (e.g. Kumar et al. 2008), our study, which is based
on almost continuous measurements over a period of 6 years, suggests that the glacier is
melting at a constant rate, which is in accordance with long-term estimates measured since
1965. Such observations are useful in assessing the glacier’s response to climate change
and provide an avenue to understand glacier dynamics and its relation to glacier surface
morphology.

Glacier mass variations have a direct impact on some of the key components of the
global water cycle, including sea level rise and freshwater availability. Apart from being
one of the largest Himalayan glaciers, Gangotri is one of the sources of water for the
Ganges river, which has a considerable inﬂuence on the socioeconomic structure of a
largely over-populated catchment area accounting for ∼26% of India’s landmass. In this
study, we present the most recent assessment of the Gangotri glacier dynamics, combin-
ing the use of interferometric techniques on synthetic aperture radar data and sub-pixel
offset tracking on Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reﬂection Radiometer
(ASTER) satellite imagery. Results show that on average, the Gangotri glacier snout
has receded at a rate of 21.3 ± 3 m year−1 over a period of 6 years (2004–2010).
While glacier surface velocity near the snout is estimated to be between 24.8 ± 2.3 and
28.9 ± 2.3 m year−1, interior portions of the glacier recorded velocities in the range of
13.9 ± 2.3 to 70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1. Further, the average glacier surface velocity in the
northern (lower) portions (28.1 ± 2.3 m year−1) is observed to be signiﬁcantly lower
than in the southern (higher) portions (48.1 ± 2.3 m year−1) of the Gangotri glacier.
These values are calculated with an uncertainty of less than 5 m year−1. Results also
highlight a consistent retreat and non-uniform dynamics of the Gangotri glacier.

Introduction
The impact of climate change on glaciers of the world has been a topic of active concern
in recent times (Syed et al. 2007; Bagla 2009; Cogley et al. 2010). While glacial melt is a
major source of freshwater that contributes to global mean sea level rise (Meier et al. 2007;
Jacob et al. 2012), decreasing glacial mass has an impact on the freshwater resources of
some of the largest river basins in the world, including that of the Ganges (e.g. Kumar,
Singh, and Sharma 2005; Mall et al. 2006; Immerzeel, van Beek, and Bierkens 2010;
Kaser, Grosshauser, and Marzeion 2010). Fluctuations in the recession rate of glaciers dur-
ing recent years have initiated widespread discussions, especially in the context of global
warming and its effects (Dyurgerov and Meier 2005). Similar ice mass changes have also
been reported in the Garhwal region of the Himalayas (Kulkarni et al. 2005; Bhambri,
Bolch, and Chaujar 2011a, 2011b; Kulkarni et al. 2011; Bolch et al. 2012). However, the

status of the Gangotri glacier warrants further investigation, particularly in the context of
climate change resulting in continuous retreat, negative mass balance, and early melting of
seasonal snow cover (Negi et al. 2012).
Glaciers cover about 40,800 km2 of the Himalayan and Karakoram mountain region,
and are one of the main sources of water to some of the largest rivers in the world, including
the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Indus (Kulkarni et al. 2011; Bajracharya and Shrestha 2011;
Bolch et al. 2012). Approximately 10% of the summer discharge of the Ganges is attributed
to melt waters from glaciers (Barnett, Adam, and Letternmaier 2005; Jain, Agarwal, and
Singh 2007; Immerzeel, van Beek, and Bierkens 2010; Bolch et al. 2012). Rapid depletion
of glaciers has had adverse effects on the ﬂow regime of major Himalayan rivers, and can
even lead to catastrophic events such as glacial lake outbursts (Govindha 2010; Shrestha,
Eriksson, and Mool 2010; Ashraf, Naz, and Roohi 2012) and consequent ﬂooding in the
upper reaches of these rivers, affecting the lives of millions of people residing in the Indo-
Gangetic plains (Richardson and Reynolds 2000; Bolch et al. 2012).
In spite of their hydrologic, climatic, and socioeconomic signiﬁcance, opportunities for
precise and continuous monitoring of the Himalayan glaciers are limited by logistical and
terrain-induced difﬁculties. Observations of Earth’s surface using satellite data have proven
to be very useful in such monitoring; recent developments in high-resolution image acqui-
sition have facilitated more precise monitoring of glacier movement (Luckman, Quincey,
and Bevan 2007; Kumar, Venkataraman, and Hogda 2011; Kumar et al. 2011). Further,
satellite data enables a gross analysis of glacier mass budgets, overcoming some of the
problems of accessibility and sustainability of long-term measurements, that can later be
veriﬁed with ground-based surveys (Kumar et al. 2008). The potential of remote sensing
for glacier mass balance and velocity mapping has been demonstrated with optical (e.g.
Kääb 2005; Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker 2008), synthetic aperture radar (SAR) (e.g.
Luckman, Quincey, and Bevan 2007), and thermal infrared sensors (e.g. Nakawo, Yabuki,
and Sakai 1999), and elevation models (Bolch, Pieczonka, and Benn 2011), among others.
Developments in deriving ﬂow rates and monitoring Himalayan glacier retreat using optical
images have been made by Kääb (2005). However, this approach is sometimes limited by
weather, clouds, and shadows in areas of high relief.
In a novel approach, the current study presents one of the most comprehensive assess-
ments of the Gangotri glacier in recent times (2004–2011). The methodology entails the
utilization of interferometric SAR (InSAR) coherence and sub-pixel offset tracking. While
complementing most previous studies, the result presented here establishes the effective-
ness of the techniques implemented to produce robust estimates of areal changes and glacier
surface velocity in near real time. But, perhaps most importantly, this is one of the few stud-
ies which has shown the melting trend of Gangotri glacier over a considerably continuous
period during recent times (2004–2011).

Study area
The Gangotri glacier is a valley-type glacier and one of the largest Himalayan glaciers
located in Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand, India (Figure 1). Extending between the lat-
itudes 30◦ 43′ 22′′ N–30◦ 55′ 49′′ N and longitudes 79◦ 4′ 41′′ E–79◦ 16′ 34′′ E, Gangotri
is the only major Himalayan glacier that ﬂows towards the northwest. It spans a length
of 30.2 km, its width varies between 0.20 and 2.35 km, and it thereby covers an area of
about 86.32 km2. While the average thickness of the Gangotri glacier is ∼200 m, its sur-
face elevation varies from 4000 to 7000 m above mean sea level (Jain 2008). Gangotri has
three main tributaries, namely the Raktvarna, the Chaturangi, and the Kirti, with lengths

18 small tributary glaciers of Gangotri and its tributaries. Gangotri and other glaciers in
this region are mostly fed by the summer monsoon and partly by winter snow. Western
disturbances cause heavy snowfall from December to March over this region (Thayyen and
Gergan 2010). Generally, seasonal melting starts in the month of May and continues till
October (Dobhal, Gergan, and Thayyen 2008).

Data and methods
3.1.
Coherence detection for glacier retreat
InSAR provides avenues to study glaciers in terms of snout and glacial lake monitoring, as
well as ground displacement and topographic variations, using interferograms (Luckman,
Quincey, and Bevan 2007; Kumar et al. 2008; Capps et al. 2010). Glacier monitoring using
InSAR is advancing towards new frontiers; in this study, we develop coherence maps using
SAR image pairs to map the location of the snout of the Gangotri glacier. Previously, this
technique has been utilized to delineate glacier extent (Atwood, Meyer, and Arendt 2010)
and to identify debris-covered portions of glaciers in the northwest Himalayas (Frey, Paul,
and Strozzi 2012). In this study, we utilize the coherency attribute between two SAR images
for snout monitoring. We estimate coherence of interferograms made from two SAR acqui-
sitions with the spatial correlation of the InSAR phase over small areas of pixels (Fielding
et al. 2005). This phase correlation is related to the relative displacement of the scatter-
ing objects within each pixel and large surface motion during the time between two SAR
acquisitions. While higher values of coherence are associated with small motion and disrup-
tion of the surface, lower values are representative of considerable displacement or surface
changes over a speciﬁed time period. Practically, it can help in understanding the stabil-
ity of the terrain imaged. Ice, which is constantly melting and accumulating in addition
to ﬂowing laterally, shows very low relative coherence even if the images have a small
temporal baseline. InSAR coherence estimates typically involve a bias of ∼20% in areas

P. Saraswat et al.
of low coherence, so we consider relative values of coherence instead of the absolute val-
ues in order to characterize the stability of the surface. The terminus, where the ground is
exposed as a consequence of glacier retreat, shows better coherence compared to the pix-
els within the glacier (Atwood, Meyer, and Arendt 2010). To delineate a high coherence
zone, which is ice-free ground, we apply a threshold of 0.4 (40%) to InSAR correlation to
select the areas of high coherence from the interferograms. This is based on the assump-
tion that high coherence values are largely due to the presence of ice-free surface near the
glacier snout. The retreat rate is calculated as the distance measured between the mapped
snout in ﬁrst image pair (in this case 2004–2005) and last image pair (2009–2010) along
the central ﬂow line of the glacier. However, coherence of the non-glaciated portions of
land ahead of the terminus may be subsequently affected by ﬂowing melt water from the
glacier. This shortcoming was surpassed by selecting images during early summer (March–
May) and early winter (October–December) with relatively short acquisition intervals over
the Gangotri region. The coherence analysis is based on InSAR, incorporating data sets
acquired by the advanced synthetic aperture radar (ASAR) instrument mounted on the
Envisat satellite (Image Mode; see Table 1). The orbital models for Envisat used in this
study were obtained from ESA Doris orbits (DOR) and processing was performed with
the JPL/Caltech ROI_pac software (Rosen et al. 2004). Digital elevation model (DEM)
data are required to remove and model topographic phase contributions, and to orthorec-
tify the data for intercomparison. Here, we use NASA’s Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission
(SRTM) (Rodriguez, Morris, and Belz 2006) DEM with voids ﬁlled by other sources, avail-
able from Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) Consortium
for Spatial Information (CGIAR-CSI) (http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/). These void-ﬁlled DEMs
(SRTM CGIAR version 3) are particularly effective for the study area since they are
constructed using topographic maps and information from local topography.
However, at times InSAR fails to produce reliable measurements of ice motion for
fast moving glaciers primarily due to temporal decorrelation or loss of coherence, in the
absence of optimal temporal baseline between the image pairs. This aspect is one of the
major limitations associated with this technique. Further, steep slopes, particularly in the
Gangotri region, inhibit an across-track view of the glacier and render SAR data from the
widely available satellites unreliable for glacier velocity measurements. Due to the absence
of Envisat SAR pairs with short time intervals over the study area (minimum possible

repeat time of Envisat was 35 days, but not every orbit had SAR images acquired), tem-
poral decorrelation is a major issue encountered in this study. For the available pairs, the
glacier motion is large enough to cause incoherent InSAR leading to temporal decorrela-
tion. Hence, the absence of good coherence between subsequent SAR image pairs makes it
difﬁcult to measure the Gangotri ice velocity with Envisat InSAR.
3.2.
Velocity measurements using pixel offset tracking
Mapping the glacier surface velocity is crucial for characterizing ice dynamics and quan-
tifying glacier ice mass balance (Bindschadler and Scambos 1991; Joughin et al. 2002;
Rignot and Thomas 2002). In order to overcome the previously mentioned region-speciﬁc
limitation of InSAR in mapping glacier velocity, we took an alternative approach to monitor
glacier velocities utilizing sub-pixel offset tracking on nadir-viewing near infrared (NIR)
imagery from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reﬂection Radiometer
(ASTER). This technique utilizes cross-correlation between two images to estimate sur-
face velocities, details of which are illustrated in Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008).
Pixel offset tracking or sub-pixel correlation is a technique to measure the motion of spa-
tially coherent features through time between two images (Crippen 1992). In glaciology,
these features generally consist of crevasses, undulations, and moraines (Konig, Winther,
and Isaksson 2001). The horizontal displacement thus obtained can be used to generate
velocity maps utilizing the time difference between the images pairs. In this study, the
ENVI- and IDL-based processing software, Co-registration of Optically Sensed Images
and Correlation (COSI-Corr) (Leprince et al. 2007), is used for the said purpose. This
method has been successfully used for measuring glacier velocities such as those in Stearns,
Hamilton, and Reeh (2005), Howat et al. (2008), Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008),
Debella-Gilo and Kääb (2011), Herman, Anderson, and Leprince (2011), and Willis et al.
(2012). Initially, a DEM is used to generate approximate tie points for the master image,
and we used the same SRTM 3-arcsecond DEM with the voids ﬁlled by the CGIAR group
(Version 3) as described above. Tie points are then subjected to an optimization algo-
rithm in order to generate precise ground control points to orthorectify the master image.
Once the master image is orthorectiﬁed, ensuing slave images are orthorectiﬁed using
the same master image. After successful orthorectiﬁcation and co-registration of image
pairs, a correlation algorithm is then applied by moving the correlation windows across
the prepared images on a regular grid. Distinctive features are tracked between image
pairs and their displacement is calculated to produce displacement maps and their cor-
responding signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) maps. Note that the methodology implemented
here is exactly the same as that presented in Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008)
and is most appropriate for additional details on the methodology and functionality of
COSI-Corr.
In order to overcome the limitation of producing high quality velocity estimates from
InSAR, a sub-pixel correlation or offset tracking technique is employed on ASTER L1A
satellite imagery acquired for the region. Table 2 enlists the details of the ASTER L1A data
set analysed in this study. For better results, maximum care is taken to obtain images with
less snowfall and cloud cover, especially over the Gangotri glacier. In order to analyse the
motion over the entire length of the glacier, we acquired ASTER L1A data for two frames
covering the lower and upper reaches of the Gangotri glacier. Both frames were acquired on
the same date and with the same acquisition parameters but processed separately. Another
associated advantage of ASTER imagery over SAR imagery for such difﬁcult terrain is the

availability of the 3N (NIR) band with nadir-viewing geometry and 15 m spatial resolution,
thus minimizing topography-induced errors in the velocity estimates. The images used in
this study are mostly acquired during the month of October, which is the end of the melting
season.
3.3.
Uncertainty analysis
A number of factors contribute to uncertainties in the coherence-based estimates of glacier
retreat rate, including DEM, orbital, and baseline errors. Errors in velocity estimates
obtained using pixel offset tracking can again be attributed primarily to DEM errors, which
are transferred in the form of orthorectiﬁcation errors to the orthorectiﬁed master image.
The SRTM 3-arcsecond DEM that we used has voids ﬁlled by the CGIAR group (Version
3), so the DEM quality is variable. The voids in SRTM version 2 are extensive in the steep
slopes of the Himalayas. We chose ASTER pairs with the same look angle to minimize the
effects of DEM errors since both images have the same viewing geometry. Kääb (2002)
discussed these anomalies as a ground position error, which is about 3 m for moderately
inclined terrains.
Additionally, uncertainties from resampling and image cross-correlation processes are
generally much smaller than the pixel size of 15 m; hence, matches with uncertainties
greater than one pixel are usually discarded during the processing (Scherler, Leprince, and
Strecker 2008). The cumulative error in velocity estimates is less than 5 m year−1 for the
data sets used in this study. This error is estimated by computing surface velocity for loca-
tions where stable ground is exposed typically near the snout to keep other inﬂuencing
factors such as slope and surface conditions as close to the glacier as possible. Since surface
velocity should be ideally zero in these locations, any value other than zero is approximated
as the error. In order to quantify the error, we concentrated on velocities estimated for an
area in front of the snout (Figure 4(a) (Box 1)), which is observed to be ice-free in all of
the images used in this study. Analysis showed that velocities estimated in this study suffer

8659
from a possible bias (mean) of about 4.2 m year−1 and an error (standard deviation) of
about 2.3 m year−1. The high precision in the observed estimates can be attributed to sev-
eral factors such as (1) low cloud cover in the ASTER images, (2) the scenes are obtained
for the same time period (late summer and fall), which helped to eliminate errors related to
snowfall and changes in solar illumination, and (3) the time span between paired ASTER
images are mostly kept at nearly 1 year, which provides a resolvable time window to derive
glacier surface velocities.

Results
4.1.
Glacier recession from 2004–2010
Shown in Figures 2(a) and (b) are the InSAR coherence maps of the Gangotri glacier region
obtained from image pairs with the shortest possible acquisition intervals in order to locate
the snout of the glacier with improved accuracy. The detail of interferometric pairs chosen
to study short and long-term variations of the Gangotri glacier is shown in Table 1. For the
reasons stated above we present results from coherence mapping for Pair 1 (Figure 2(a)) and
Pair 6 (Figure 2(b)). Thus, it can be observed in Figures 2(a) and (b) that by stretching the
values in the coherence maps, the majority of the region registered low coherence, caused
mainly due to accumulation and ablation of snow and ice and also due to steep slopes.
However, regions near the northern ﬂank of the glacier show high coherence (>40%),
which is attributed to the fact that the snout of the glacier has retreated, exposing boulders
and moraines. Hence, these are the areas which show more relative stability over a consid-
erable period of time (typically a few months). Areas further down the valley are likewise
seasonally snow-free but have considerable vegetation (as evident in ASTER scenes, not
shown), which produces low coherence in the image. Thus, high coherence occurs only in
those areas recently exposed by glacial retreat and not yet covered by signiﬁcant vegetation
growth, i.e. only near the glacier snout.
See Table 3 for the snout positions obtained during the period of Pair 1 (2004–2005),
Pair 5, and Pair 6 (2009–2010). These results correlate very well with the snout posi-
tions reported in a previous study, using ground-based surveys (Kumar et al. 2008). The
colour code used in Figure 2(a) and (b) shows two dominant shades, blue representing low
coherence, which is quite apparent over this region since continuous snowfall and melting,
renders most of the region incoherent. The assumption made here is that the newly exposed
surface material adjacent to the snout of the glacier, deposited by continuous recession
of the terminus, should show coherence values well above 40% and is represented by red
zones near the northern ﬂank of the glacier in Figure 2(a) and (b). The average recession
rate of the Gangotri glacier for the period 2004–2010, based on the distance between the
two snout positions (along the central ﬂow line of the glacier), obtained from the coherence
maps (Table 3), is estimated to be 21.3 ± 3 m year−1.
The recession trend is indirectly linked to the glacier mass balance, which is the net
accumulation and ablation within a year measured as the difference between the amount
of snow accumulated in winter and ice removed by melting in summer. The coherence
maps computed from each of the pairs provide insight into the extent of ice-free surface
observed during the respective time periods. Hence, stacking each of these coherence maps
will highlight the area over which terminus retreat has occurred over the entire period of
2004–2010, yielding a holistic view of the ice-free area cleared by ice over the region cov-
ered by the Gangotri glacier and its tributaries. Figure 3 shows the colour-coded coherence
map obtained by stacking the coherence images from Pairs 1, 5, and 6. This represents

Glacier velocity measurements from 2005–2011
In this study, sub-pixel offset tracking analysis is performed on ASTER pairs, acquired
around the month of October during 2005–2006, 2009–2010, and 2010–2011, that covered
the entire Gangotri glacier in two frames. This enables a recent and periodic assessment of
Gangotri glacier dynamics. Figure 4 represents a cumulative analysis plot of the Gangotri
glacier motion. A Euclidean norm of the displacement measured in the north–south and
east–west direction for Pair 2 and Pair 4 (2009–2010), after mosaicking, is shown in

pairs (indicated by bright red colour), with a maximum value of 40 ± 2.3 m year−1 in the
lower glacier (Pair 1) and 70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1 in the upper glacier (Pair 4). Considering
the time difference between the two concerned pairs, the velocity of the Gangotri glacier,
during this period, is estimated to be a maximum of 70.2 m year−1 near the head of the
glacier and less than 30 ± 2.3 m year−1 near the snout of the glacier. It is also evident from
Figure 4(a) that the Gangotri glacier recorded higher motion than the surrounding region of
steep mountain slopes, which had near zero net motion. A clear indication of glacier move-
ment is also apparent from the deﬁnite pattern of motion illustrated in the vector ﬁeld plot
shown in Figure 4(b). Streamlines of velocity vectors (shown in Figure 4(b)) clearly demar-
cate the glacier extent and illustrate the magnitude and direction of glacier ice motion.
In order to demonstrate, in greater detail, velocity variations within the Gangotri
glacier during the span of 2005–2011, glacier surface velocity along the central ﬂow line
of Gangotri (Figure 4(b)) is analysed for each of the images pairs (Table 2). Shown in
Figures 4(c) and (d) is the velocity versus distance curve drawn along the proﬁle line (Line
AB for Pairs 1, 2, and 3 and CD for Pair 4 and 5 in Figure 4(b)). As observed from the pro-
ﬁle plot for the lower reaches of Gangotri (Figure 4(c)), surface velocity variation is almost
similar for all the three pairs. However, the annual ﬂow rate for Pair 1 (2005–2006) is
comparatively lower than that of Pair 2 (2009–2010) and Pair 3 (2010–2011), particu-
larly near the snout and in the lower reaches of the glacier. In general, surface velocity
is larger at higher reaches of the glacier as compared to those near the lower reaches and
is likely dependent on variations in the glacier slope, width, and thickness. This pattern
is also evident from the proﬁle plot for higher reaches of the glacier (Figure 4(d) (also
see supplementary Figure S1 at http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2013.845923), where
the glacier mass velocity is considerably higher near the head of the Gangotri glacier, for
both the image pairs. While surface velocity near the snout, for all the time periods, varied
between 24.8 ± 2.3 to 28.9 ± 2.3 m year−1, velocities away from the snout varied between
a minimum of 13.9 ± 2.3 m year−1 to a maximum of 70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1 (in the upper
reaches of the glacier). The average velocity for the image pairs, 1, 2, and 3, are 28.1 ± 2.3,
27.9 ± 2.3, and 28.2 ± 2.3 m year−1, respectively, which is considerably lower than the
average velocities for Pair 4 and Pair 5, which are 45.7 ± 2.3 and 50.4 ± 2.3 m year−1,
respectively.

Discussion
Glacier surface velocity and retreat rate are two very important parameters that are used to
characterize glacier dynamics. This study has produced reliable estimates of both of these
parameters. The methodology involved the utilization of coherence mapping and image
stacking to locate and monitor snout movement as well as quantify the zone of melting
over a considerable time span. The observed snout positions between 2004 and 2010 are
commensurate with those observed in earlier studies. Gangotri glacier retreat rate observed
in this study is comparable to rates of 23 m year−1 (for 1985–2001) (Hasnain, Ahmad,
and Kumar 2004; Cruz et al. 2007), 17.15 m year−1 (1971–2004) (Raina 2009), 23.2 m
year−1 (for 1968–2001) (Bhambri, Bolch, and Chaujar 2011a, 2011b), and 19.9 m year−1
(for 1965–2006) (Bhambri, Bolch, and Chaujar 2012). The most recent estimate of glacier
retreat using the differential global positioning system (DGPS) and satellite imagery was
obtained to be 17.59 m year−1 for the period of 1976–2009 (Kumar, Areendran, and Rao
2009). Table 4 summarizes some of the most recently published retreat rates of the Gangotri
glacier. The retreat rate measured in this study corroborates well with most of the long-term

measurements, estimated over the past 70 years, which also establishes the efﬁcacy of the
methodology presented here. And perhaps most importantly, the results presented here indi-
cate that the most recent retreat rate of the Gangotri glacier conﬁrms a continuous retreat
of the glacier with a consistent rate taking into consideration multidecadal measurements.
The current study also addresses the phenomenon of temporal decorrelation and associ-
ated limitations of InSAR with longer time intervals for surface velocity measurements
and DEM generation for this particular region of the Eastern Himalayas. Sub-pixel offset
tracking, utilizing ASTER data, enabled high-resolution measurements of surface ice-mass
velocity, which is particularly relevant in difﬁcult mountainous terrains such as that of the
present study area (e.g. Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker 2008). A comprehensive analysis
of surface velocity of the Gangotri glacier is performed for the entire length, from snout to
the head, of the glacier. In general, the observed surface velocity variations of the Gangotri
glacier are comparatively similar for the entire range of image pairs (between 2005 and
2011) acquired for this study. However, the magnitude of glacier motion is typically low
for the period 2005–2006, which was also reported in Raina (2009). While the majority of
the incongruence amongst the spatial distribution of surface velocity is noted in the upper
reaches of the glacier, velocities near the snout are almost similar over all time periods. The
annual variations are high, which indicates fast motion of the Gangotri glacier, especially
during the period 2009–2011. These estimates are considerably higher than the short-term
estimates made by Kumar, Venkataraman, and Hogda (2011), Kumar et al. (2011), and
yearly estimates by Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008). Such high surface velocities
may indicate that ice motion in this region is dominated by basal sliding in the ablation
zone of this relatively steep glacier. The velocities estimated here are based on cumula-
tive surface displacement experienced by the glacier over a period of 1 year. Hence, these
velocity estimates do not reﬂect on its seasonal variation. The surface velocity variations
are most comparable for Pairs 2 and 3. However, on average, surface velocity is observed
to be lower during 2005–2006 compared to 2010–2011. These year-to-year variations can
be attributed to factors such as variations in meteorological conditions (Singh et al. 2006)
and the amount of basal sliding (Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker 2008) over the years.
However, yearly differences in the amount of basal sliding due to the variation in melt
water ﬂux can be a contributory factor.
The current study has the potential to provide an integrated assessment of glacier ﬂow
dynamics, to complement previous and future studies in the area and to provide a key
methodology to delineate glacial lake formation (Quincey et al. 2007; Bolch et al. 2011),
which is of major concern in the Himalayan glaciers.

Conclusions
This study provides comprehensive characterization of the dynamics of the Gangotri glacier
in terms of retreat rate and surface velocity estimates over a continuous period from 2004 to
2010. We employed SAR interferometry to quantify the snout retreat of the Gangotri glacier
in the Himalayas, exploring its capabilities for an integrated assessment of the glacier.
Results showed that the Gangotri glacier, which is one of the largest Himalayan glaciers,
retreated about 119 m over a period of 6 years (2004–2010), at an average rate of 21.3 ± 3 m
year−1. In the context of previous studies, the rate has been almost the same for the last
couple of decades. The results also demonstrated that retreat rate of the terminus was not
uniform over the 6-year period. Further, stacking coherence images from different SAR
pairs delineated the area cleared by ice from 2004 to 2010, facilitating a broader idea about
melting of Gangotri and its tributary glaciers. Results from the sub-pixel offset tracking of
ASTER images revealed signiﬁcant motion along the length of the glacier and its tributaries
compared to the surrounding region, meanwhile establishing a better picture of ﬂow char-
acteristics of the Gangotri glacier. High velocities were observed at the upper reaches of the
glacier while comparatively less movement was observed near the snout. Speciﬁcally, while
the average glacier surface velocity was estimated to be about 36.1 ± 2.3 m year−1, over the
period 2005–2011, the maximum and minimum velocities ranged between 13.9 ± 2.3 and
70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1. Overall, variation of surface velocity of ice mass over the entire length
of the Gangotri glacier was approximately similar for all of the image pairs studied for the
period 2005–2011. While most previous studies suggest a decrease in retreat rate based on
observations made over short time period (e.g. Kumar et al. 2008), our study, which is based
on almost continuous measurements over a period of 6 years, suggests that the glacier is
melting at a constant rate, which is in accordance with long-term estimates measured since
1965. Such observations are useful in assessing the glacier’s response to climate change
and provide an avenue to understand glacier dynamics and its relation to glacier surface
morphology.

Glacier mass variations have a direct impact on some of the key components of the
global water cycle, including sea level rise and freshwater availability. Apart from being
one of the largest Himalayan glaciers, Gangotri is one of the sources of water for the
Ganges river, which has a considerable inﬂuence on the socioeconomic structure of a
largely over-populated catchment area accounting for ∼26% of India’s landmass. In this
study, we present the most recent assessment of the Gangotri glacier dynamics, combin-
ing the use of interferometric techniques on synthetic aperture radar data and sub-pixel
offset tracking on Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reﬂection Radiometer
(ASTER) satellite imagery. Results show that on average, the Gangotri glacier snout
has receded at a rate of 21.3 ± 3 m year−1 over a period of 6 years (2004–2010).
While glacier surface velocity near the snout is estimated to be between 24.8 ± 2.3 and
28.9 ± 2.3 m year−1, interior portions of the glacier recorded velocities in the range of
13.9 ± 2.3 to 70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1. Further, the average glacier surface velocity in the
northern (lower) portions (28.1 ± 2.3 m year−1) is observed to be signiﬁcantly lower
than in the southern (higher) portions (48.1 ± 2.3 m year−1) of the Gangotri glacier.
These values are calculated with an uncertainty of less than 5 m year−1. Results also
highlight a consistent retreat and non-uniform dynamics of the Gangotri glacier.

Introduction
The impact of climate change on glaciers of the world has been a topic of active concern
in recent times (Syed et al. 2007; Bagla 2009; Cogley et al. 2010). While glacial melt is a
major source of freshwater that contributes to global mean sea level rise (Meier et al. 2007;
Jacob et al. 2012), decreasing glacial mass has an impact on the freshwater resources of
some of the largest river basins in the world, including that of the Ganges (e.g. Kumar,
Singh, and Sharma 2005; Mall et al. 2006; Immerzeel, van Beek, and Bierkens 2010;
Kaser, Grosshauser, and Marzeion 2010). Fluctuations in the recession rate of glaciers dur-
ing recent years have initiated widespread discussions, especially in the context of global
warming and its effects (Dyurgerov and Meier 2005). Similar ice mass changes have also
been reported in the Garhwal region of the Himalayas (Kulkarni et al. 2005; Bhambri,
Bolch, and Chaujar 2011a, 2011b; Kulkarni et al. 2011; Bolch et al. 2012). However, the

status of the Gangotri glacier warrants further investigation, particularly in the context of
climate change resulting in continuous retreat, negative mass balance, and early melting of
seasonal snow cover (Negi et al. 2012).
Glaciers cover about 40,800 km2 of the Himalayan and Karakoram mountain region,
and are one of the main sources of water to some of the largest rivers in the world, including
the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Indus (Kulkarni et al. 2011; Bajracharya and Shrestha 2011;
Bolch et al. 2012). Approximately 10% of the summer discharge of the Ganges is attributed
to melt waters from glaciers (Barnett, Adam, and Letternmaier 2005; Jain, Agarwal, and
Singh 2007; Immerzeel, van Beek, and Bierkens 2010; Bolch et al. 2012). Rapid depletion
of glaciers has had adverse effects on the ﬂow regime of major Himalayan rivers, and can
even lead to catastrophic events such as glacial lake outbursts (Govindha 2010; Shrestha,
Eriksson, and Mool 2010; Ashraf, Naz, and Roohi 2012) and consequent ﬂooding in the
upper reaches of these rivers, affecting the lives of millions of people residing in the Indo-
Gangetic plains (Richardson and Reynolds 2000; Bolch et al. 2012).
In spite of their hydrologic, climatic, and socioeconomic signiﬁcance, opportunities for
precise and continuous monitoring of the Himalayan glaciers are limited by logistical and
terrain-induced difﬁculties. Observations of Earth’s surface using satellite data have proven
to be very useful in such monitoring; recent developments in high-resolution image acqui-
sition have facilitated more precise monitoring of glacier movement (Luckman, Quincey,
and Bevan 2007; Kumar, Venkataraman, and Hogda 2011; Kumar et al. 2011). Further,
satellite data enables a gross analysis of glacier mass budgets, overcoming some of the
problems of accessibility and sustainability of long-term measurements, that can later be
veriﬁed with ground-based surveys (Kumar et al. 2008). The potential of remote sensing
for glacier mass balance and velocity mapping has been demonstrated with optical (e.g.
Kääb 2005; Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker 2008), synthetic aperture radar (SAR) (e.g.
Luckman, Quincey, and Bevan 2007), and thermal infrared sensors (e.g. Nakawo, Yabuki,
and Sakai 1999), and elevation models (Bolch, Pieczonka, and Benn 2011), among others.
Developments in deriving ﬂow rates and monitoring Himalayan glacier retreat using optical
images have been made by Kääb (2005). However, this approach is sometimes limited by
weather, clouds, and shadows in areas of high relief.
In a novel approach, the current study presents one of the most comprehensive assess-
ments of the Gangotri glacier in recent times (2004–2011). The methodology entails the
utilization of interferometric SAR (InSAR) coherence and sub-pixel offset tracking. While
complementing most previous studies, the result presented here establishes the effective-
ness of the techniques implemented to produce robust estimates of areal changes and glacier
surface velocity in near real time. But, perhaps most importantly, this is one of the few stud-
ies which has shown the melting trend of Gangotri glacier over a considerably continuous
period during recent times (2004–2011).

Study area
The Gangotri glacier is a valley-type glacier and one of the largest Himalayan glaciers
located in Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand, India (Figure 1). Extending between the lat-
itudes 30◦ 43′ 22′′ N–30◦ 55′ 49′′ N and longitudes 79◦ 4′ 41′′ E–79◦ 16′ 34′′ E, Gangotri
is the only major Himalayan glacier that ﬂows towards the northwest. It spans a length
of 30.2 km, its width varies between 0.20 and 2.35 km, and it thereby covers an area of
about 86.32 km2. While the average thickness of the Gangotri glacier is ∼200 m, its sur-
face elevation varies from 4000 to 7000 m above mean sea level (Jain 2008). Gangotri has
three main tributaries, namely the Raktvarna, the Chaturangi, and the Kirti, with lengths

18 small tributary glaciers of Gangotri and its tributaries. Gangotri and other glaciers in
this region are mostly fed by the summer monsoon and partly by winter snow. Western
disturbances cause heavy snowfall from December to March over this region (Thayyen and
Gergan 2010). Generally, seasonal melting starts in the month of May and continues till
October (Dobhal, Gergan, and Thayyen 2008).

Data and methods
3.1.
Coherence detection for glacier retreat
InSAR provides avenues to study glaciers in terms of snout and glacial lake monitoring, as
well as ground displacement and topographic variations, using interferograms (Luckman,
Quincey, and Bevan 2007; Kumar et al. 2008; Capps et al. 2010). Glacier monitoring using
InSAR is advancing towards new frontiers; in this study, we develop coherence maps using
SAR image pairs to map the location of the snout of the Gangotri glacier. Previously, this
technique has been utilized to delineate glacier extent (Atwood, Meyer, and Arendt 2010)
and to identify debris-covered portions of glaciers in the northwest Himalayas (Frey, Paul,
and Strozzi 2012). In this study, we utilize the coherency attribute between two SAR images
for snout monitoring. We estimate coherence of interferograms made from two SAR acqui-
sitions with the spatial correlation of the InSAR phase over small areas of pixels (Fielding
et al. 2005). This phase correlation is related to the relative displacement of the scatter-
ing objects within each pixel and large surface motion during the time between two SAR
acquisitions. While higher values of coherence are associated with small motion and disrup-
tion of the surface, lower values are representative of considerable displacement or surface
changes over a speciﬁed time period. Practically, it can help in understanding the stabil-
ity of the terrain imaged. Ice, which is constantly melting and accumulating in addition
to ﬂowing laterally, shows very low relative coherence even if the images have a small
temporal baseline. InSAR coherence estimates typically involve a bias of ∼20% in areas

P. Saraswat et al.
of low coherence, so we consider relative values of coherence instead of the absolute val-
ues in order to characterize the stability of the surface. The terminus, where the ground is
exposed as a consequence of glacier retreat, shows better coherence compared to the pix-
els within the glacier (Atwood, Meyer, and Arendt 2010). To delineate a high coherence
zone, which is ice-free ground, we apply a threshold of 0.4 (40%) to InSAR correlation to
select the areas of high coherence from the interferograms. This is based on the assump-
tion that high coherence values are largely due to the presence of ice-free surface near the
glacier snout. The retreat rate is calculated as the distance measured between the mapped
snout in ﬁrst image pair (in this case 2004–2005) and last image pair (2009–2010) along
the central ﬂow line of the glacier. However, coherence of the non-glaciated portions of
land ahead of the terminus may be subsequently affected by ﬂowing melt water from the
glacier. This shortcoming was surpassed by selecting images during early summer (March–
May) and early winter (October–December) with relatively short acquisition intervals over
the Gangotri region. The coherence analysis is based on InSAR, incorporating data sets
acquired by the advanced synthetic aperture radar (ASAR) instrument mounted on the
Envisat satellite (Image Mode; see Table 1). The orbital models for Envisat used in this
study were obtained from ESA Doris orbits (DOR) and processing was performed with
the JPL/Caltech ROI_pac software (Rosen et al. 2004). Digital elevation model (DEM)
data are required to remove and model topographic phase contributions, and to orthorec-
tify the data for intercomparison. Here, we use NASA’s Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission
(SRTM) (Rodriguez, Morris, and Belz 2006) DEM with voids ﬁlled by other sources, avail-
able from Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) Consortium
for Spatial Information (CGIAR-CSI) (http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/). These void-ﬁlled DEMs
(SRTM CGIAR version 3) are particularly effective for the study area since they are
constructed using topographic maps and information from local topography.
However, at times InSAR fails to produce reliable measurements of ice motion for
fast moving glaciers primarily due to temporal decorrelation or loss of coherence, in the
absence of optimal temporal baseline between the image pairs. This aspect is one of the
major limitations associated with this technique. Further, steep slopes, particularly in the
Gangotri region, inhibit an across-track view of the glacier and render SAR data from the
widely available satellites unreliable for glacier velocity measurements. Due to the absence
of Envisat SAR pairs with short time intervals over the study area (minimum possible

repeat time of Envisat was 35 days, but not every orbit had SAR images acquired), tem-
poral decorrelation is a major issue encountered in this study. For the available pairs, the
glacier motion is large enough to cause incoherent InSAR leading to temporal decorrela-
tion. Hence, the absence of good coherence between subsequent SAR image pairs makes it
difﬁcult to measure the Gangotri ice velocity with Envisat InSAR.
3.2.
Velocity measurements using pixel offset tracking
Mapping the glacier surface velocity is crucial for characterizing ice dynamics and quan-
tifying glacier ice mass balance (Bindschadler and Scambos 1991; Joughin et al. 2002;
Rignot and Thomas 2002). In order to overcome the previously mentioned region-speciﬁc
limitation of InSAR in mapping glacier velocity, we took an alternative approach to monitor
glacier velocities utilizing sub-pixel offset tracking on nadir-viewing near infrared (NIR)
imagery from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reﬂection Radiometer
(ASTER). This technique utilizes cross-correlation between two images to estimate sur-
face velocities, details of which are illustrated in Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008).
Pixel offset tracking or sub-pixel correlation is a technique to measure the motion of spa-
tially coherent features through time between two images (Crippen 1992). In glaciology,
these features generally consist of crevasses, undulations, and moraines (Konig, Winther,
and Isaksson 2001). The horizontal displacement thus obtained can be used to generate
velocity maps utilizing the time difference between the images pairs. In this study, the
ENVI- and IDL-based processing software, Co-registration of Optically Sensed Images
and Correlation (COSI-Corr) (Leprince et al. 2007), is used for the said purpose. This
method has been successfully used for measuring glacier velocities such as those in Stearns,
Hamilton, and Reeh (2005), Howat et al. (2008), Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008),
Debella-Gilo and Kääb (2011), Herman, Anderson, and Leprince (2011), and Willis et al.
(2012). Initially, a DEM is used to generate approximate tie points for the master image,
and we used the same SRTM 3-arcsecond DEM with the voids ﬁlled by the CGIAR group
(Version 3) as described above. Tie points are then subjected to an optimization algo-
rithm in order to generate precise ground control points to orthorectify the master image.
Once the master image is orthorectiﬁed, ensuing slave images are orthorectiﬁed using
the same master image. After successful orthorectiﬁcation and co-registration of image
pairs, a correlation algorithm is then applied by moving the correlation windows across
the prepared images on a regular grid. Distinctive features are tracked between image
pairs and their displacement is calculated to produce displacement maps and their cor-
responding signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) maps. Note that the methodology implemented
here is exactly the same as that presented in Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008)
and is most appropriate for additional details on the methodology and functionality of
COSI-Corr.
In order to overcome the limitation of producing high quality velocity estimates from
InSAR, a sub-pixel correlation or offset tracking technique is employed on ASTER L1A
satellite imagery acquired for the region. Table 2 enlists the details of the ASTER L1A data
set analysed in this study. For better results, maximum care is taken to obtain images with
less snowfall and cloud cover, especially over the Gangotri glacier. In order to analyse the
motion over the entire length of the glacier, we acquired ASTER L1A data for two frames
covering the lower and upper reaches of the Gangotri glacier. Both frames were acquired on
the same date and with the same acquisition parameters but processed separately. Another
associated advantage of ASTER imagery over SAR imagery for such difﬁcult terrain is the

availability of the 3N (NIR) band with nadir-viewing geometry and 15 m spatial resolution,
thus minimizing topography-induced errors in the velocity estimates. The images used in
this study are mostly acquired during the month of October, which is the end of the melting
season.
3.3.
Uncertainty analysis
A number of factors contribute to uncertainties in the coherence-based estimates of glacier
retreat rate, including DEM, orbital, and baseline errors. Errors in velocity estimates
obtained using pixel offset tracking can again be attributed primarily to DEM errors, which
are transferred in the form of orthorectiﬁcation errors to the orthorectiﬁed master image.
The SRTM 3-arcsecond DEM that we used has voids ﬁlled by the CGIAR group (Version
3), so the DEM quality is variable. The voids in SRTM version 2 are extensive in the steep
slopes of the Himalayas. We chose ASTER pairs with the same look angle to minimize the
effects of DEM errors since both images have the same viewing geometry. Kääb (2002)
discussed these anomalies as a ground position error, which is about 3 m for moderately
inclined terrains.
Additionally, uncertainties from resampling and image cross-correlation processes are
generally much smaller than the pixel size of 15 m; hence, matches with uncertainties
greater than one pixel are usually discarded during the processing (Scherler, Leprince, and
Strecker 2008). The cumulative error in velocity estimates is less than 5 m year−1 for the
data sets used in this study. This error is estimated by computing surface velocity for loca-
tions where stable ground is exposed typically near the snout to keep other inﬂuencing
factors such as slope and surface conditions as close to the glacier as possible. Since surface
velocity should be ideally zero in these locations, any value other than zero is approximated
as the error. In order to quantify the error, we concentrated on velocities estimated for an
area in front of the snout (Figure 4(a) (Box 1)), which is observed to be ice-free in all of
the images used in this study. Analysis showed that velocities estimated in this study suffer

from a possible bias (mean) of about 4.2 m year−1 and an error (standard deviation) of
about 2.3 m year−1. The high precision in the observed estimates can be attributed to sev-
eral factors such as (1) low cloud cover in the ASTER images, (2) the scenes are obtained
for the same time period (late summer and fall), which helped to eliminate errors related to
snowfall and changes in solar illumination, and (3) the time span between paired ASTER
images are mostly kept at nearly 1 year, which provides a resolvable time window to derive
glacier surface velocities.

Results
4.1.
Glacier recession from 2004–2010
Shown in Figures 2(a) and (b) are the InSAR coherence maps of the Gangotri glacier region
obtained from image pairs with the shortest possible acquisition intervals in order to locate
the snout of the glacier with improved accuracy. The detail of interferometric pairs chosen
to study short and long-term variations of the Gangotri glacier is shown in Table 1. For the
reasons stated above we present results from coherence mapping for Pair 1 (Figure 2(a)) and
Pair 6 (Figure 2(b)). Thus, it can be observed in Figures 2(a) and (b) that by stretching the
values in the coherence maps, the majority of the region registered low coherence, caused
mainly due to accumulation and ablation of snow and ice and also due to steep slopes.
However, regions near the northern ﬂank of the glacier show high coherence (>40%),
which is attributed to the fact that the snout of the glacier has retreated, exposing boulders
and moraines. Hence, these are the areas which show more relative stability over a consid-
erable period of time (typically a few months). Areas further down the valley are likewise
seasonally snow-free but have considerable vegetation (as evident in ASTER scenes, not
shown), which produces low coherence in the image. Thus, high coherence occurs only in
those areas recently exposed by glacial retreat and not yet covered by signiﬁcant vegetation
growth, i.e. only near the glacier snout.
See Table 3 for the snout positions obtained during the period of Pair 1 (2004–2005),
Pair 5, and Pair 6 (2009–2010). These results correlate very well with the snout posi-
tions reported in a previous study, using ground-based surveys (Kumar et al. 2008). The
colour code used in Figure 2(a) and (b) shows two dominant shades, blue representing low
coherence, which is quite apparent over this region since continuous snowfall and melting,
renders most of the region incoherent. The assumption made here is that the newly exposed
surface material adjacent to the snout of the glacier, deposited by continuous recession
of the terminus, should show coherence values well above 40% and is represented by red
zones near the northern ﬂank of the glacier in Figure 2(a) and (b). The average recession
rate of the Gangotri glacier for the period 2004–2010, based on the distance between the
two snout positions (along the central ﬂow line of the glacier), obtained from the coherence
maps (Table 3), is estimated to be 21.3 ± 3 m year−1.
The recession trend is indirectly linked to the glacier mass balance, which is the net
accumulation and ablation within a year measured as the difference between the amount
of snow accumulated in winter and ice removed by melting in summer. The coherence
maps computed from each of the pairs provide insight into the extent of ice-free surface
observed during the respective time periods. Hence, stacking each of these coherence maps
will highlight the area over which terminus retreat has occurred over the entire period of
2004–2010, yielding a holistic view of the ice-free area cleared by ice over the region cov-
ered by the Gangotri glacier and its tributaries. Figure 3 shows the colour-coded coherence
map obtained by stacking the coherence images from Pairs 1, 5, and 6. This represents

Glacier velocity measurements from 2005–2011
In this study, sub-pixel offset tracking analysis is performed on ASTER pairs, acquired
around the month of October during 2005–2006, 2009–2010, and 2010–2011, that covered
the entire Gangotri glacier in two frames. This enables a recent and periodic assessment of
Gangotri glacier dynamics. Figure 4 represents a cumulative analysis plot of the Gangotri
glacier motion. A Euclidean norm of the displacement measured in the north–south and
east–west direction for Pair 2 and Pair 4 (2009–2010), after mosaicking, is shown in

pairs (indicated by bright red colour), with a maximum value of 40 ± 2.3 m year−1 in the
lower glacier (Pair 1) and 70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1 in the upper glacier (Pair 4). Considering
the time difference between the two concerned pairs, the velocity of the Gangotri glacier,
during this period, is estimated to be a maximum of 70.2 m year−1 near the head of the
glacier and less than 30 ± 2.3 m year−1 near the snout of the glacier. It is also evident from
Figure 4(a) that the Gangotri glacier recorded higher motion than the surrounding region of
steep mountain slopes, which had near zero net motion. A clear indication of glacier move-
ment is also apparent from the deﬁnite pattern of motion illustrated in the vector ﬁeld plot
shown in Figure 4(b). Streamlines of velocity vectors (shown in Figure 4(b)) clearly demar-
cate the glacier extent and illustrate the magnitude and direction of glacier ice motion.
In order to demonstrate, in greater detail, velocity variations within the Gangotri
glacier during the span of 2005–2011, glacier surface velocity along the central ﬂow line
of Gangotri (Figure 4(b)) is analysed for each of the images pairs (Table 2). Shown in
Figures 4(c) and (d) is the velocity versus distance curve drawn along the proﬁle line (Line
AB for Pairs 1, 2, and 3 and CD for Pair 4 and 5 in Figure 4(b)). As observed from the pro-
ﬁle plot for the lower reaches of Gangotri (Figure 4(c)), surface velocity variation is almost
similar for all the three pairs. However, the annual ﬂow rate for Pair 1 (2005–2006) is
comparatively lower than that of Pair 2 (2009–2010) and Pair 3 (2010–2011), particu-
larly near the snout and in the lower reaches of the glacier. In general, surface velocity
is larger at higher reaches of the glacier as compared to those near the lower reaches and
is likely dependent on variations in the glacier slope, width, and thickness. This pattern
is also evident from the proﬁle plot for higher reaches of the glacier (Figure 4(d) (also
see supplementary Figure S1 at http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2013.845923), where
the glacier mass velocity is considerably higher near the head of the Gangotri glacier, for
both the image pairs. While surface velocity near the snout, for all the time periods, varied
between 24.8 ± 2.3 to 28.9 ± 2.3 m year−1, velocities away from the snout varied between
a minimum of 13.9 ± 2.3 m year−1 to a maximum of 70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1 (in the upper
reaches of the glacier). The average velocity for the image pairs, 1, 2, and 3, are 28.1 ± 2.3,
27.9 ± 2.3, and 28.2 ± 2.3 m year−1, respectively, which is considerably lower than the
average velocities for Pair 4 and Pair 5, which are 45.7 ± 2.3 and 50.4 ± 2.3 m year−1,
respectively.

Discussion
Glacier surface velocity and retreat rate are two very important parameters that are used to
characterize glacier dynamics. This study has produced reliable estimates of both of these
parameters. The methodology involved the utilization of coherence mapping and image
stacking to locate and monitor snout movement as well as quantify the zone of melting
over a considerable time span. The observed snout positions between 2004 and 2010 are
commensurate with those observed in earlier studies. Gangotri glacier retreat rate observed
in this study is comparable to rates of 23 m year−1 (for 1985–2001) (Hasnain, Ahmad,
and Kumar 2004; Cruz et al. 2007), 17.15 m year−1 (1971–2004) (Raina 2009), 23.2 m
year−1 (for 1968–2001) (Bhambri, Bolch, and Chaujar 2011a, 2011b), and 19.9 m year−1
(for 1965–2006) (Bhambri, Bolch, and Chaujar 2012). The most recent estimate of glacier
retreat using the differential global positioning system (DGPS) and satellite imagery was
obtained to be 17.59 m year−1 for the period of 1976–2009 (Kumar, Areendran, and Rao
2009). Table 4 summarizes some of the most recently published retreat rates of the Gangotri
glacier. The retreat rate measured in this study corroborates well with most of the long-term

measurements, estimated over the past 70 years, which also establishes the efﬁcacy of the
methodology presented here. And perhaps most importantly, the results presented here indi-
cate that the most recent retreat rate of the Gangotri glacier conﬁrms a continuous retreat
of the glacier with a consistent rate taking into consideration multidecadal measurements.
The current study also addresses the phenomenon of temporal decorrelation and associ-
ated limitations of InSAR with longer time intervals for surface velocity measurements
and DEM generation for this particular region of the Eastern Himalayas. Sub-pixel offset
tracking, utilizing ASTER data, enabled high-resolution measurements of surface ice-mass
velocity, which is particularly relevant in difﬁcult mountainous terrains such as that of the
present study area (e.g. Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker 2008). A comprehensive analysis
of surface velocity of the Gangotri glacier is performed for the entire length, from snout to
the head, of the glacier. In general, the observed surface velocity variations of the Gangotri
glacier are comparatively similar for the entire range of image pairs (between 2005 and
2011) acquired for this study. However, the magnitude of glacier motion is typically low
for the period 2005–2006, which was also reported in Raina (2009). While the majority of
the incongruence amongst the spatial distribution of surface velocity is noted in the upper
reaches of the glacier, velocities near the snout are almost similar over all time periods. The
annual variations are high, which indicates fast motion of the Gangotri glacier, especially
during the period 2009–2011. These estimates are considerably higher than the short-term
estimates made by Kumar, Venkataraman, and Hogda (2011), Kumar et al. (2011), and
yearly estimates by Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008). Such high surface velocities
may indicate that ice motion in this region is dominated by basal sliding in the ablation
zone of this relatively steep glacier. The velocities estimated here are based on cumula-
tive surface displacement experienced by the glacier over a period of 1 year. Hence, these
velocity estimates do not reﬂect on its seasonal variation. The surface velocity variations
are most comparable for Pairs 2 and 3. However, on average, surface velocity is observed
to be lower during 2005–2006 compared to 2010–2011. These year-to-year variations can
be attributed to factors such as variations in meteorological conditions (Singh et al. 2006)
and the amount of basal sliding (Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker 2008) over the years.
However, yearly differences in the amount of basal sliding due to the variation in melt
water ﬂux can be a contributory factor.
The current study has the potential to provide an integrated assessment of glacier ﬂow
dynamics, to complement previous and future studies in the area and to provide a key
methodology to delineate glacial lake formation (Quincey et al. 2007; Bolch et al. 2011),
which is of major concern in the Himalayan glaciers.

Conclusions
This study provides comprehensive characterization of the dynamics of the Gangotri glacier
in terms of retreat rate and surface velocity estimates over a continuous period from 2004 to
2010. We employed SAR interferometry to quantify the snout retreat of the Gangotri glacier
in the Himalayas, exploring its capabilities for an integrated assessment of the glacier.
Results showed that the Gangotri glacier, which is one of the largest Himalayan glaciers,
retreated about 119 m over a period of 6 years (2004–2010), at an average rate of 21.3 ± 3 m
year−1. In the context of previous studies, the rate has been almost the same for the last
couple of decades. The results also demonstrated that retreat rate of the terminus was not
uniform over the 6-year period. Further, stacking coherence images from different SAR
pairs delineated the area cleared by ice from 2004 to 2010, facilitating a broader idea about
melting of Gangotri and its tributary glaciers. Results from the sub-pixel offset tracking of
ASTER images revealed signiﬁcant motion along the length of the glacier and its tributaries
compared to the surrounding region, meanwhile establishing a better picture of ﬂow char-
acteristics of the Gangotri glacier. High velocities were observed at the upper reaches of the
glacier while comparatively less movement was observed near the snout. Speciﬁcally, while
the average glacier surface velocity was estimated to be about 36.1 ± 2.3 m year−1, over the
period 2005–2011, the maximum and minimum velocities ranged between 13.9 ± 2.3 and
70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1. Overall, variation of surface velocity of ice mass over the entire length
of the Gangotri glacier was approximately similar for all of the image pairs studied for the
period 2005–2011. While most previous studies suggest a decrease in retreat rate based on
observations made over short time period (e.g. Kumar et al. 2008), our study, which is based
on almost continuous measurements over a period of 6 years, suggests that the glacier is
melting at a constant rate, which is in accordance with long-term estimates measured since
1965. Such observations are useful in assessing the glacier’s response to climate change
and provide an avenue to understand glacier dynamics and its relation to glacier surface
morphology.

(Received 19 October 2012; accepted 2 September 2013)
Glacier mass variations have a direct impact on some of the key components of the
global water cycle, including sea level rise and freshwater availability. Apart from being
one of the largest Himalayan glaciers, Gangotri is one of the sources of water for the
Ganges river, which has a considerable inﬂuence on the socioeconomic structure of a
largely over-populated catchment area accounting for ∼26% of India’s landmass. In this
study, we present the most recent assessment of the Gangotri glacier dynamics, combin-
ing the use of interferometric techniques on synthetic aperture radar data and sub-pixel
offset tracking on Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reﬂection Radiometer
(ASTER) satellite imagery. Results show that on average, the Gangotri glacier snout
has receded at a rate of 21.3 ± 3 m year−1 over a period of 6 years (2004–2010).
While glacier surface velocity near the snout is estimated to be between 24.8 ± 2.3 and
28.9 ± 2.3 m year−1, interior portions of the glacier recorded velocities in the range of
13.9 ± 2.3 to 70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1. Further, the average glacier surface velocity in the
northern (lower) portions (28.1 ± 2.3 m year−1) is observed to be signiﬁcantly lower
than in the southern (higher) portions (48.1 ± 2.3 m year−1) of the Gangotri glacier.
These values are calculated with an uncertainty of less than 5 m year−1. Results also
highlight a consistent retreat and non-uniform dynamics of the Gangotri glacier.

Introduction
The impact of climate change on glaciers of the world has been a topic of active concern
in recent times (Syed et al. 2007; Bagla 2009; Cogley et al. 2010). While glacial melt is a
major source of freshwater that contributes to global mean sea level rise (Meier et al. 2007;
Jacob et al. 2012), decreasing glacial mass has an impact on the freshwater resources of
some of the largest river basins in the world, including that of the Ganges (e.g. Kumar,
Singh, and Sharma 2005; Mall et al. 2006; Immerzeel, van Beek, and Bierkens 2010;
Kaser, Grosshauser, and Marzeion 2010). Fluctuations in the recession rate of glaciers dur-
ing recent years have initiated widespread discussions, especially in the context of global
warming and its effects (Dyurgerov and Meier 2005). Similar ice mass changes have also
been reported in the Garhwal region of the Himalayas (Kulkarni et al. 2005; Bhambri,
Bolch, and Chaujar 2011a, 2011b; Kulkarni et al. 2011; Bolch et al. 2012). However, the

status of the Gangotri glacier warrants further investigation, particularly in the context of
climate change resulting in continuous retreat, negative mass balance, and early melting of
seasonal snow cover (Negi et al. 2012).
Glaciers cover about 40,800 km2 of the Himalayan and Karakoram mountain region,
and are one of the main sources of water to some of the largest rivers in the world, including
the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Indus (Kulkarni et al. 2011; Bajracharya and Shrestha 2011;
Bolch et al. 2012). Approximately 10% of the summer discharge of the Ganges is attributed
to melt waters from glaciers (Barnett, Adam, and Letternmaier 2005; Jain, Agarwal, and
Singh 2007; Immerzeel, van Beek, and Bierkens 2010; Bolch et al. 2012). Rapid depletion
of glaciers has had adverse effects on the ﬂow regime of major Himalayan rivers, and can
even lead to catastrophic events such as glacial lake outbursts (Govindha 2010; Shrestha,
Eriksson, and Mool 2010; Ashraf, Naz, and Roohi 2012) and consequent ﬂooding in the
upper reaches of these rivers, affecting the lives of millions of people residing in the Indo-
Gangetic plains (Richardson and Reynolds 2000; Bolch et al. 2012).
In spite of their hydrologic, climatic, and socioeconomic signiﬁcance, opportunities for
precise and continuous monitoring of the Himalayan glaciers are limited by logistical and
terrain-induced difﬁculties. Observations of Earth’s surface using satellite data have proven
to be very useful in such monitoring; recent developments in high-resolution image acqui-
sition have facilitated more precise monitoring of glacier movement (Luckman, Quincey,
and Bevan 2007; Kumar, Venkataraman, and Hogda 2011; Kumar et al. 2011). Further,
satellite data enables a gross analysis of glacier mass budgets, overcoming some of the
problems of accessibility and sustainability of long-term measurements, that can later be
veriﬁed with ground-based surveys (Kumar et al. 2008). The potential of remote sensing
for glacier mass balance and velocity mapping has been demonstrated with optical (e.g.
Kääb 2005; Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker 2008), synthetic aperture radar (SAR) (e.g.
Luckman, Quincey, and Bevan 2007), and thermal infrared sensors (e.g. Nakawo, Yabuki,
and Sakai 1999), and elevation models (Bolch, Pieczonka, and Benn 2011), among others.
Developments in deriving ﬂow rates and monitoring Himalayan glacier retreat using optical
images have been made by Kääb (2005). However, this approach is sometimes limited by
weather, clouds, and shadows in areas of high relief.
In a novel approach, the current study presents one of the most comprehensive assess-
ments of the Gangotri glacier in recent times (2004–2011). The methodology entails the
utilization of interferometric SAR (InSAR) coherence and sub-pixel offset tracking. While
complementing most previous studies, the result presented here establishes the effective-
ness of the techniques implemented to produce robust estimates of areal changes and glacier
surface velocity in near real time. But, perhaps most importantly, this is one of the few stud-
ies which has shown the melting trend of Gangotri glacier over a considerably continuous
period during recent times (2004–2011).

Study area
The Gangotri glacier is a valley-type glacier and one of the largest Himalayan glaciers
located in Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand, India (Figure 1). Extending between the lat-
itudes 30◦ 43′ 22′′ N–30◦ 55′ 49′′ N and longitudes 79◦ 4′ 41′′ E–79◦ 16′ 34′′ E, Gangotri
is the only major Himalayan glacier that ﬂows towards the northwest. It spans a length
of 30.2 km, its width varies between 0.20 and 2.35 km, and it thereby covers an area of
about 86.32 km2. While the average thickness of the Gangotri glacier is ∼200 m, its sur-
face elevation varies from 4000 to 7000 m above mean sea level (Jain 2008). Gangotri has
three main tributaries, namely the Raktvarna, the Chaturangi, and the Kirti, with lengths

18 small tributary glaciers of Gangotri and its tributaries. Gangotri and other glaciers in
this region are mostly fed by the summer monsoon and partly by winter snow. Western
disturbances cause heavy snowfall from December to March over this region (Thayyen and
Gergan 2010). Generally, seasonal melting starts in the month of May and continues till
October (Dobhal, Gergan, and Thayyen 2008).

Data and methods
3.1.
Coherence detection for glacier retreat
InSAR provides avenues to study glaciers in terms of snout and glacial lake monitoring, as
well as ground displacement and topographic variations, using interferograms (Luckman,
Quincey, and Bevan 2007; Kumar et al. 2008; Capps et al. 2010). Glacier monitoring using
InSAR is advancing towards new frontiers; in this study, we develop coherence maps using
SAR image pairs to map the location of the snout of the Gangotri glacier. Previously, this
technique has been utilized to delineate glacier extent (Atwood, Meyer, and Arendt 2010)
and to identify debris-covered portions of glaciers in the northwest Himalayas (Frey, Paul,
and Strozzi 2012). In this study, we utilize the coherency attribute between two SAR images
for snout monitoring. We estimate coherence of interferograms made from two SAR acqui-
sitions with the spatial correlation of the InSAR phase over small areas of pixels (Fielding
et al. 2005). This phase correlation is related to the relative displacement of the scatter-
ing objects within each pixel and large surface motion during the time between two SAR
acquisitions. While higher values of coherence are associated with small motion and disrup-
tion of the surface, lower values are representative of considerable displacement or surface
changes over a speciﬁed time period. Practically, it can help in understanding the stabil-
ity of the terrain imaged. Ice, which is constantly melting and accumulating in addition
to ﬂowing laterally, shows very low relative coherence even if the images have a small
temporal baseline. InSAR coherence estimates typically involve a bias of ∼20% in areas

P. Saraswat et al.
of low coherence, so we consider relative values of coherence instead of the absolute val-
ues in order to characterize the stability of the surface. The terminus, where the ground is
exposed as a consequence of glacier retreat, shows better coherence compared to the pix-
els within the glacier (Atwood, Meyer, and Arendt 2010). To delineate a high coherence
zone, which is ice-free ground, we apply a threshold of 0.4 (40%) to InSAR correlation to
select the areas of high coherence from the interferograms. This is based on the assump-
tion that high coherence values are largely due to the presence of ice-free surface near the
glacier snout. The retreat rate is calculated as the distance measured between the mapped
snout in ﬁrst image pair (in this case 2004–2005) and last image pair (2009–2010) along
the central ﬂow line of the glacier. However, coherence of the non-glaciated portions of
land ahead of the terminus may be subsequently affected by ﬂowing melt water from the
glacier. This shortcoming was surpassed by selecting images during early summer (March–
May) and early winter (October–December) with relatively short acquisition intervals over
the Gangotri region. The coherence analysis is based on InSAR, incorporating data sets
acquired by the advanced synthetic aperture radar (ASAR) instrument mounted on the
Envisat satellite (Image Mode; see Table 1). The orbital models for Envisat used in this
study were obtained from ESA Doris orbits (DOR) and processing was performed with
the JPL/Caltech ROI_pac software (Rosen et al. 2004). Digital elevation model (DEM)
data are required to remove and model topographic phase contributions, and to orthorec-
tify the data for intercomparison. Here, we use NASA’s Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission
(SRTM) (Rodriguez, Morris, and Belz 2006) DEM with voids ﬁlled by other sources, avail-
able from Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) Consortium
for Spatial Information (CGIAR-CSI) (http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/). These void-ﬁlled DEMs
(SRTM CGIAR version 3) are particularly effective for the study area since they are
constructed using topographic maps and information from local topography.
However, at times InSAR fails to produce reliable measurements of ice motion for
fast moving glaciers primarily due to temporal decorrelation or loss of coherence, in the
absence of optimal temporal baseline between the image pairs. This aspect is one of the
major limitations associated with this technique. Further, steep slopes, particularly in the
Gangotri region, inhibit an across-track view of the glacier and render SAR data from the
widely available satellites unreliable for glacier velocity measurements. Due to the absence
of Envisat SAR pairs with short time intervals over the study area (minimum possible

repeat time of Envisat was 35 days, but not every orbit had SAR images acquired), tem-
poral decorrelation is a major issue encountered in this study. For the available pairs, the
glacier motion is large enough to cause incoherent InSAR leading to temporal decorrela-
tion. Hence, the absence of good coherence between subsequent SAR image pairs makes it
difﬁcult to measure the Gangotri ice velocity with Envisat InSAR.
3.2.
Velocity measurements using pixel offset tracking
Mapping the glacier surface velocity is crucial for characterizing ice dynamics and quan-
tifying glacier ice mass balance (Bindschadler and Scambos 1991; Joughin et al. 2002;
Rignot and Thomas 2002). In order to overcome the previously mentioned region-speciﬁc
limitation of InSAR in mapping glacier velocity, we took an alternative approach to monitor
glacier velocities utilizing sub-pixel offset tracking on nadir-viewing near infrared (NIR)
imagery from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reﬂection Radiometer
(ASTER). This technique utilizes cross-correlation between two images to estimate sur-
face velocities, details of which are illustrated in Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008).
Pixel offset tracking or sub-pixel correlation is a technique to measure the motion of spa-
tially coherent features through time between two images (Crippen 1992). In glaciology,
these features generally consist of crevasses, undulations, and moraines (Konig, Winther,
and Isaksson 2001). The horizontal displacement thus obtained can be used to generate
velocity maps utilizing the time difference between the images pairs. In this study, the
ENVI- and IDL-based processing software, Co-registration of Optically Sensed Images
and Correlation (COSI-Corr) (Leprince et al. 2007), is used for the said purpose. This
method has been successfully used for measuring glacier velocities such as those in Stearns,
Hamilton, and Reeh (2005), Howat et al. (2008), Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008),
Debella-Gilo and Kääb (2011), Herman, Anderson, and Leprince (2011), and Willis et al.
(2012). Initially, a DEM is used to generate approximate tie points for the master image,
and we used the same SRTM 3-arcsecond DEM with the voids ﬁlled by the CGIAR group
(Version 3) as described above. Tie points are then subjected to an optimization algo-
rithm in order to generate precise ground control points to orthorectify the master image.
Once the master image is orthorectiﬁed, ensuing slave images are orthorectiﬁed using
the same master image. After successful orthorectiﬁcation and co-registration of image
pairs, a correlation algorithm is then applied by moving the correlation windows across
the prepared images on a regular grid. Distinctive features are tracked between image
pairs and their displacement is calculated to produce displacement maps and their cor-
responding signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) maps. Note that the methodology implemented
here is exactly the same as that presented in Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008)
and is most appropriate for additional details on the methodology and functionality of
COSI-Corr.
In order to overcome the limitation of producing high quality velocity estimates from
InSAR, a sub-pixel correlation or offset tracking technique is employed on ASTER L1A
satellite imagery acquired for the region. Table 2 enlists the details of the ASTER L1A data
set analysed in this study. For better results, maximum care is taken to obtain images with
less snowfall and cloud cover, especially over the Gangotri glacier. In order to analyse the
motion over the entire length of the glacier, we acquired ASTER L1A data for two frames
covering the lower and upper reaches of the Gangotri glacier. Both frames were acquired on
the same date and with the same acquisition parameters but processed separately. Another
associated advantage of ASTER imagery over SAR imagery for such difﬁcult terrain is the

availability of the 3N (NIR) band with nadir-viewing geometry and 15 m spatial resolution,
thus minimizing topography-induced errors in the velocity estimates. The images used in
this study are mostly acquired during the month of October, which is the end of the melting
season.
3.3.
Uncertainty analysis
A number of factors contribute to uncertainties in the coherence-based estimates of glacier
retreat rate, including DEM, orbital, and baseline errors. Errors in velocity estimates
obtained using pixel offset tracking can again be attributed primarily to DEM errors, which
are transferred in the form of orthorectiﬁcation errors to the orthorectiﬁed master image.
The SRTM 3-arcsecond DEM that we used has voids ﬁlled by the CGIAR group (Version
3), so the DEM quality is variable. The voids in SRTM version 2 are extensive in the steep
slopes of the Himalayas. We chose ASTER pairs with the same look angle to minimize the
effects of DEM errors since both images have the same viewing geometry. Kääb (2002)
discussed these anomalies as a ground position error, which is about 3 m for moderately
inclined terrains.
Additionally, uncertainties from resampling and image cross-correlation processes are
generally much smaller than the pixel size of 15 m; hence, matches with uncertainties
greater than one pixel are usually discarded during the processing (Scherler, Leprince, and
Strecker 2008). The cumulative error in velocity estimates is less than 5 m year−1 for the
data sets used in this study. This error is estimated by computing surface velocity for loca-
tions where stable ground is exposed typically near the snout to keep other inﬂuencing
factors such as slope and surface conditions as close to the glacier as possible. Since surface
velocity should be ideally zero in these locations, any value other than zero is approximated
as the error. In order to quantify the error, we concentrated on velocities estimated for an
area in front of the snout (Figure 4(a) (Box 1)), which is observed to be ice-free in all of
the images used in this study. Analysis showed that velocities estimated in this study suffer

from a possible bias (mean) of about 4.2 m year−1 and an error (standard deviation) of
about 2.3 m year−1. The high precision in the observed estimates can be attributed to sev-
eral factors such as (1) low cloud cover in the ASTER images, (2) the scenes are obtained
for the same time period (late summer and fall), which helped to eliminate errors related to
snowfall and changes in solar illumination, and (3) the time span between paired ASTER
images are mostly kept at nearly 1 year, which provides a resolvable time window to derive
glacier surface velocities.

Results
4.1.
Glacier recession from 2004–2010
Shown in Figures 2(a) and (b) are the InSAR coherence maps of the Gangotri glacier region
obtained from image pairs with the shortest possible acquisition intervals in order to locate
the snout of the glacier with improved accuracy. The detail of interferometric pairs chosen
to study short and long-term variations of the Gangotri glacier is shown in Table 1. For the
reasons stated above we present results from coherence mapping for Pair 1 (Figure 2(a)) and
Pair 6 (Figure 2(b)). Thus, it can be observed in Figures 2(a) and (b) that by stretching the
values in the coherence maps, the majority of the region registered low coherence, caused
mainly due to accumulation and ablation of snow and ice and also due to steep slopes.
However, regions near the northern ﬂank of the glacier show high coherence (>40%),
which is attributed to the fact that the snout of the glacier has retreated, exposing boulders
and moraines. Hence, these are the areas which show more relative stability over a consid-
erable period of time (typically a few months). Areas further down the valley are likewise
seasonally snow-free but have considerable vegetation (as evident in ASTER scenes, not
shown), which produces low coherence in the image. Thus, high coherence occurs only in
those areas recently exposed by glacial retreat and not yet covered by signiﬁcant vegetation
growth, i.e. only near the glacier snout.
See Table 3 for the snout positions obtained during the period of Pair 1 (2004–2005),
Pair 5, and Pair 6 (2009–2010). These results correlate very well with the snout posi-
tions reported in a previous study, using ground-based surveys (Kumar et al. 2008). The
colour code used in Figure 2(a) and (b) shows two dominant shades, blue representing low
coherence, which is quite apparent over this region since continuous snowfall and melting,
renders most of the region incoherent. The assumption made here is that the newly exposed
surface material adjacent to the snout of the glacier, deposited by continuous recession
of the terminus, should show coherence values well above 40% and is represented by red
zones near the northern ﬂank of the glacier in Figure 2(a) and (b). The average recession
rate of the Gangotri glacier for the period 2004–2010, based on the distance between the
two snout positions (along the central ﬂow line of the glacier), obtained from the coherence
maps (Table 3), is estimated to be 21.3 ± 3 m year−1.
The recession trend is indirectly linked to the glacier mass balance, which is the net
accumulation and ablation within a year measured as the difference between the amount
of snow accumulated in winter and ice removed by melting in summer. The coherence
maps computed from each of the pairs provide insight into the extent of ice-free surface
observed during the respective time periods. Hence, stacking each of these coherence maps
will highlight the area over which terminus retreat has occurred over the entire period of
2004–2010, yielding a holistic view of the ice-free area cleared by ice over the region cov-
ered by the Gangotri glacier and its tributaries. Figure 3 shows the colour-coded coherence
map obtained by stacking the coherence images from Pairs 1, 5, and 6. This represents

Glacier velocity measurements from 2005–2011

around the month of October during 2005–2006, 2009–2010, and 2010–2011, that covered
the entire Gangotri glacier in two frames. This enables a recent and periodic assessment of
Gangotri glacier dynamics. Figure 4 represents a cumulative analysis plot of the Gangotri
glacier motion. A Euclidean norm of the displacement measured in the north–south and

pairs (indicated by bright red colour), with a maximum value of 40 ± 2.3 m year−1 in the
lower glacier (Pair 1) and 70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1 in the upper glacier (Pair 4). Considering
the time difference between the two concerned pairs, the velocity of the Gangotri glacier,
during this period, is estimated to be a maximum of 70.2 m year−1 near the head of the
glacier and less than 30 ± 2.3 m year−1 near the snout of the glacier. It is also evident from
Figure 4(a) that the Gangotri glacier recorded higher motion than the surrounding region of
steep mountain slopes, which had near zero net motion. A clear indication of glacier move-
ment is also apparent from the deﬁnite pattern of motion illustrated in the vector ﬁeld plot
shown in Figure 4(b). Streamlines of velocity vectors (shown in Figure 4(b)) clearly demar-
cate the glacier extent and illustrate the magnitude and direction of glacier ice motion.
In order to demonstrate, in greater detail, velocity variations within the Gangotri
glacier during the span of 2005–2011, glacier surface velocity along the central ﬂow line
of Gangotri (Figure 4(b)) is analysed for each of the images pairs (Table 2). Shown in
Figures 4(c) and (d) is the velocity versus distance curve drawn along the proﬁle line (Line
AB for Pairs 1, 2, and 3 and CD for Pair 4 and 5 in Figure 4(b)). As observed from the pro-
ﬁle plot for the lower reaches of Gangotri (Figure 4(c)), surface velocity variation is almost
similar for all the three pairs. However, the annual ﬂow rate for Pair 1 (2005–2006) is
comparatively lower than that of Pair 2 (2009–2010) and Pair 3 (2010–2011), particu-
larly near the snout and in the lower reaches of the glacier. In general, surface velocity
is larger at higher reaches of the glacier as compared to those near the lower reaches and
is likely dependent on variations in the glacier slope, width, and thickness. This pattern
is also evident from the proﬁle plot for higher reaches of the glacier (Figure 4(d) (also
see supplementary Figure S1 at http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2013.845923), where
the glacier mass velocity is considerably higher near the head of the Gangotri glacier, for
both the image pairs. While surface velocity near the snout, for all the time periods, varied
between 24.8 ± 2.3 to 28.9 ± 2.3 m year−1, velocities away from the snout varied between
a minimum of 13.9 ± 2.3 m year−1 to a maximum of 70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1 (in the upper
reaches of the glacier). The average velocity for the image pairs, 1, 2, and 3, are 28.1 ± 2.3,
27.9 ± 2.3, and 28.2 ± 2.3 m year−1, respectively, which is considerably lower than the
average velocities for Pair 4 and Pair 5, which are 45.7 ± 2.3 and 50.4 ± 2.3 m year−1,
respectively.

Discussion
Glacier surface velocity and retreat rate are two very important parameters that are used to
characterize glacier dynamics. This study has produced reliable estimates of both of these
parameters. The methodology involved the utilization of coherence mapping and image
stacking to locate and monitor snout movement as well as quantify the zone of melting
over a considerable time span. The observed snout positions between 2004 and 2010 are
commensurate with those observed in earlier studies. Gangotri glacier retreat rate observed
in this study is comparable to rates of 23 m year−1 (for 1985–2001) (Hasnain, Ahmad,
and Kumar 2004; Cruz et al. 2007), 17.15 m year−1 (1971–2004) (Raina 2009), 23.2 m
year−1 (for 1968–2001) (Bhambri, Bolch, and Chaujar 2011a, 2011b), and 19.9 m year−1
(for 1965–2006) (Bhambri, Bolch, and Chaujar 2012). The most recent estimate of glacier
retreat using the differential global positioning system (DGPS) and satellite imagery was
obtained to be 17.59 m year−1 for the period of 1976–2009 (Kumar, Areendran, and Rao
2009). Table 4 summarizes some of the most recently published retreat rates of the Gangotri
glacier. The retreat rate measured in this study corroborates well with most of the long-term

measurements, estimated over the past 70 years, which also establishes the efﬁcacy of the
methodology presented here. And perhaps most importantly, the results presented here indi-
cate that the most recent retreat rate of the Gangotri glacier conﬁrms a continuous retreat
of the glacier with a consistent rate taking into consideration multidecadal measurements.
The current study also addresses the phenomenon of temporal decorrelation and associ-
ated limitations of InSAR with longer time intervals for surface velocity measurements
and DEM generation for this particular region of the Eastern Himalayas. Sub-pixel offset
tracking, utilizing ASTER data, enabled high-resolution measurements of surface ice-mass
velocity, which is particularly relevant in difﬁcult mountainous terrains such as that of the
present study area (e.g. Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker 2008). A comprehensive analysis
of surface velocity of the Gangotri glacier is performed for the entire length, from snout to
the head, of the glacier. In general, the observed surface velocity variations of the Gangotri
glacier are comparatively similar for the entire range of image pairs (between 2005 and
2011) acquired for this study. However, the magnitude of glacier motion is typically low
for the period 2005–2006, which was also reported in Raina (2009). While the majority of
the incongruence amongst the spatial distribution of surface velocity is noted in the upper
reaches of the glacier, velocities near the snout are almost similar over all time periods. The
annual variations are high, which indicates fast motion of the Gangotri glacier, especially
during the period 2009–2011. These estimates are considerably higher than the short-term
estimates made by Kumar, Venkataraman, and Hogda (2011), Kumar et al. (2011), and
yearly estimates by Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008). Such high surface velocities
may indicate that ice motion in this region is dominated by basal sliding in the ablation
zone of this relatively steep glacier. The velocities estimated here are based on cumula-
tive surface displacement experienced by the glacier over a period of 1 year. Hence, these
velocity estimates do not reﬂect on its seasonal variation. The surface velocity variations
are most comparable for Pairs 2 and 3. However, on average, surface velocity is observed
to be lower during 2005–2006 compared to 2010–2011. These year-to-year variations can
be attributed to factors such as variations in meteorological conditions (Singh et al. 2006)
and the amount of basal sliding (Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker 2008) over the years.
However, yearly differences in the amount of basal sliding due to the variation in melt
water ﬂux can be a contributory factor.
The current study has the potential to provide an integrated assessment of glacier ﬂow
dynamics, to complement previous and future studies in the area and to provide a key
methodology to delineate glacial lake formation (Quincey et al. 2007; Bolch et al. 2011),
which is of major concern in the Himalayan glaciers.

Conclusions
This study provides comprehensive characterization of the dynamics of the Gangotri glacier
in terms of retreat rate and surface velocity estimates over a continuous period from 2004 to
2010. We employed SAR interferometry to quantify the snout retreat of the Gangotri glacier
in the Himalayas, exploring its capabilities for an integrated assessment of the glacier.
Results showed that the Gangotri glacier, which is one of the largest Himalayan glaciers,
retreated about 119 m over a period of 6 years (2004–2010), at an average rate of 21.3 ± 3 m
year−1. In the context of previous studies, the rate has been almost the same for the last
couple of decades. The results also demonstrated that retreat rate of the terminus was not
uniform over the 6-year period. Further, stacking coherence images from different SAR
pairs delineated the area cleared by ice from 2004 to 2010, facilitating a broader idea about
melting of Gangotri and its tributary glaciers. Results from the sub-pixel offset tracking of
ASTER images revealed signiﬁcant motion along the length of the glacier and its tributaries
compared to the surrounding region, meanwhile establishing a better picture of ﬂow char-
acteristics of the Gangotri glacier. High velocities were observed at the upper reaches of the
glacier while comparatively less movement was observed near the snout. Speciﬁcally, while
the average glacier surface velocity was estimated to be about 36.1 ± 2.3 m year−1, over the
period 2005–2011, the maximum and minimum velocities ranged between 13.9 ± 2.3 and
70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1. Overall, variation of surface velocity of ice mass over the entire length
of the Gangotri glacier was approximately similar for all of the image pairs studied for the
period 2005–2011. While most previous studies suggest a decrease in retreat rate based on
observations made over short time period (e.g. Kumar et al. 2008), our study, which is based
on almost continuous measurements over a period of 6 years, suggests that the glacier is
melting at a constant rate, which is in accordance with long-term estimates measured since
1965. Such observations are useful in assessing the glacier’s response to climate change
and provide an avenue to understand glacier dynamics and its relation to glacier surface
morphology.

Glacier mass variations have a direct impact on some of the key components of the
global water cycle, including sea level rise and freshwater availability. Apart from being
one of the largest Himalayan glaciers, Gangotri is one of the sources of water for the
Ganges river, which has a considerable inﬂuence on the socioeconomic structure of a
largely over-populated catchment area accounting for ∼26% of India’s landmass. In this
study, we present the most recent assessment of the Gangotri glacier dynamics, combin-
ing the use of interferometric techniques on synthetic aperture radar data and sub-pixel
offset tracking on Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reﬂection Radiometer
(ASTER) satellite imagery. Results show that on average, the Gangotri glacier snout
has receded at a rate of 21.3 ± 3 m year−1 over a period of 6 years (2004–2010).
While glacier surface velocity near the snout is estimated to be between 24.8 ± 2.3 and
28.9 ± 2.3 m year−1, interior portions of the glacier recorded velocities in the range of
13.9 ± 2.3 to 70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1. Further, the average glacier surface velocity in the
northern (lower) portions (28.1 ± 2.3 m year−1) is observed to be signiﬁcantly lower
than in the southern (higher) portions (48.1 ± 2.3 m year−1) of the Gangotri glacier.
These values are calculated with an uncertainty of less than 5 m year−1. Results also
highlight a consistent retreat and non-uniform dynamics of the Gangotri glacier.

Introduction
The impact of climate change on glaciers of the world has been a topic of active concern
in recent times (Syed et al. 2007; Bagla 2009; Cogley et al. 2010). While glacial melt is a
major source of freshwater that contributes to global mean sea level rise (Meier et al. 2007;
Jacob et al. 2012), decreasing glacial mass has an impact on the freshwater resources of
some of the largest river basins in the world, including that of the Ganges (e.g. Kumar,
Singh, and Sharma 2005; Mall et al. 2006; Immerzeel, van Beek, and Bierkens 2010;
Kaser, Grosshauser, and Marzeion 2010). Fluctuations in the recession rate of glaciers dur-
ing recent years have initiated widespread discussions, especially in the context of global
warming and its effects (Dyurgerov and Meier 2005). Similar ice mass changes have also
been reported in the Garhwal region of the Himalayas (Kulkarni et al. 2005; Bhambri,
Bolch, and Chaujar 2011a, 2011b; Kulkarni et al. 2011; Bolch et al. 2012). However, the

status of the Gangotri glacier warrants further investigation, particularly in the context of
climate change resulting in continuous retreat, negative mass balance, and early melting of
seasonal snow cover (Negi et al. 2012).
Glaciers cover about 40,800 km2 of the Himalayan and Karakoram mountain region,
and are one of the main sources of water to some of the largest rivers in the world, including
the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Indus (Kulkarni et al. 2011; Bajracharya and Shrestha 2011;
Bolch et al. 2012). Approximately 10% of the summer discharge of the Ganges is attributed
to melt waters from glaciers (Barnett, Adam, and Letternmaier 2005; Jain, Agarwal, and
Singh 2007; Immerzeel, van Beek, and Bierkens 2010; Bolch et al. 2012). Rapid depletion
of glaciers has had adverse effects on the ﬂow regime of major Himalayan rivers, and can
even lead to catastrophic events such as glacial lake outbursts (Govindha 2010; Shrestha,
Eriksson, and Mool 2010; Ashraf, Naz, and Roohi 2012) and consequent ﬂooding in the
upper reaches of these rivers, affecting the lives of millions of people residing in the Indo-
Gangetic plains (Richardson and Reynolds 2000; Bolch et al. 2012).
In spite of their hydrologic, climatic, and socioeconomic signiﬁcance, opportunities for
precise and continuous monitoring of the Himalayan glaciers are limited by logistical and
terrain-induced difﬁculties. Observations of Earth’s surface using satellite data have proven
to be very useful in such monitoring; recent developments in high-resolution image acqui-
sition have facilitated more precise monitoring of glacier movement (Luckman, Quincey,
and Bevan 2007; Kumar, Venkataraman, and Hogda 2011; Kumar et al. 2011). Further,
satellite data enables a gross analysis of glacier mass budgets, overcoming some of the
problems of accessibility and sustainability of long-term measurements, that can later be
veriﬁed with ground-based surveys (Kumar et al. 2008). The potential of remote sensing
for glacier mass balance and velocity mapping has been demonstrated with optical (e.g.
Kääb 2005; Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker 2008), synthetic aperture radar (SAR) (e.g.
Luckman, Quincey, and Bevan 2007), and thermal infrared sensors (e.g. Nakawo, Yabuki,
and Sakai 1999), and elevation models (Bolch, Pieczonka, and Benn 2011), among others.
Developments in deriving ﬂow rates and monitoring Himalayan glacier retreat using optical
images have been made by Kääb (2005). However, this approach is sometimes limited by
weather, clouds, and shadows in areas of high relief.
In a novel approach, the current study presents one of the most comprehensive assess-
ments of the Gangotri glacier in recent times (2004–2011). The methodology entails the
utilization of interferometric SAR (InSAR) coherence and sub-pixel offset tracking. While
complementing most previous studies, the result presented here establishes the effective-
ness of the techniques implemented to produce robust estimates of areal changes and glacier
surface velocity in near real time. But, perhaps most importantly, this is one of the few stud-
ies which has shown the melting trend of Gangotri glacier over a considerably continuous
period during recent times (2004–2011).

Study area
The Gangotri glacier is a valley-type glacier and one of the largest Himalayan glaciers
located in Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand, India (Figure 1). Extending between the lat-
itudes 30◦ 43′ 22′′ N–30◦ 55′ 49′′ N and longitudes 79◦ 4′ 41′′ E–79◦ 16′ 34′′ E, Gangotri
is the only major Himalayan glacier that ﬂows towards the northwest. It spans a length
of 30.2 km, its width varies between 0.20 and 2.35 km, and it thereby covers an area of
about 86.32 km2. While the average thickness of the Gangotri glacier is ∼200 m, its sur-
face elevation varies from 4000 to 7000 m above mean sea level (Jain 2008). Gangotri has
three main tributaries, namely the Raktvarna, the Chaturangi, and the Kirti, with lengths

of 15.90, 22.45, and 11.05 km, respectively (Figure 1). Additionally, there are more than
18 small tributary glaciers of Gangotri and its tributaries. Gangotri and other glaciers in
this region are mostly fed by the summer monsoon and partly by winter snow. Western
disturbances cause heavy snowfall from December to March over this region (Thayyen and
Gergan 2010). Generally, seasonal melting starts in the month of May and continues till
October (Dobhal, Gergan, and Thayyen 2008).

Data and methods
3.1.
Coherence detection for glacier retreat
InSAR provides avenues to study glaciers in terms of snout and glacial lake monitoring, as
well as ground displacement and topographic variations, using interferograms (Luckman,
Quincey, and Bevan 2007; Kumar et al. 2008; Capps et al. 2010). Glacier monitoring using
InSAR is advancing towards new frontiers; in this study, we develop coherence maps using
SAR image pairs to map the location of the snout of the Gangotri glacier. Previously, this
technique has been utilized to delineate glacier extent (Atwood, Meyer, and Arendt 2010)
and to identify debris-covered portions of glaciers in the northwest Himalayas (Frey, Paul,
and Strozzi 2012). In this study, we utilize the coherency attribute between two SAR images
for snout monitoring. We estimate coherence of interferograms made from two SAR acqui-
sitions with the spatial correlation of the InSAR phase over small areas of pixels (Fielding
et al. 2005). This phase correlation is related to the relative displacement of the scatter-
ing objects within each pixel and large surface motion during the time between two SAR
acquisitions. While higher values of coherence are associated with small motion and disrup-
tion of the surface, lower values are representative of considerable displacement or surface
changes over a speciﬁed time period. Practically, it can help in understanding the stabil-
ity of the terrain imaged. Ice, which is constantly melting and accumulating in addition
to ﬂowing laterally, shows very low relative coherence even if the images have a small
temporal baseline. InSAR coherence estimates typically involve a bias of ∼20% in areas

P. Saraswat et al.
of low coherence, so we consider relative values of coherence instead of the absolute val-
ues in order to characterize the stability of the surface. The terminus, where the ground is
exposed as a consequence of glacier retreat, shows better coherence compared to the pix-
els within the glacier (Atwood, Meyer, and Arendt 2010). To delineate a high coherence
zone, which is ice-free ground, we apply a threshold of 0.4 (40%) to InSAR correlation to
select the areas of high coherence from the interferograms. This is based on the assump-
tion that high coherence values are largely due to the presence of ice-free surface near the
glacier snout. The retreat rate is calculated as the distance measured between the mapped
snout in ﬁrst image pair (in this case 2004–2005) and last image pair (2009–2010) along
the central ﬂow line of the glacier. However, coherence of the non-glaciated portions of
land ahead of the terminus may be subsequently affected by ﬂowing melt water from the
glacier. This shortcoming was surpassed by selecting images during early summer (March–
May) and early winter (October–December) with relatively short acquisition intervals over
the Gangotri region. The coherence analysis is based on InSAR, incorporating data sets
acquired by the advanced synthetic aperture radar (ASAR) instrument mounted on the
Envisat satellite (Image Mode; see Table 1). The orbital models for Envisat used in this
study were obtained from ESA Doris orbits (DOR) and processing was performed with
the JPL/Caltech ROI_pac software (Rosen et al. 2004). Digital elevation model (DEM)
data are required to remove and model topographic phase contributions, and to orthorec-
tify the data for intercomparison. Here, we use NASA’s Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission
(SRTM) (Rodriguez, Morris, and Belz 2006) DEM with voids ﬁlled by other sources, avail-
able from Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) Consortium
for Spatial Information (CGIAR-CSI) (http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/). These void-ﬁlled DEMs
(SRTM CGIAR version 3) are particularly effective for the study area since they are
constructed using topographic maps and information from local topography.
However, at times InSAR fails to produce reliable measurements of ice motion for
fast moving glaciers primarily due to temporal decorrelation or loss of coherence, in the
absence of optimal temporal baseline between the image pairs. This aspect is one of the
major limitations associated with this technique. Further, steep slopes, particularly in the
Gangotri region, inhibit an across-track view of the glacier and render SAR data from the
widely available satellites unreliable for glacier velocity measurements. Due to the absence
of Envisat SAR pairs with short time intervals over the study area (minimum possible

repeat time of Envisat was 35 days, but not every orbit had SAR images acquired), tem-
poral decorrelation is a major issue encountered in this study. For the available pairs, the
glacier motion is large enough to cause incoherent InSAR leading to temporal decorrela-
tion. Hence, the absence of good coherence between subsequent SAR image pairs makes it
difﬁcult to measure the Gangotri ice velocity with Envisat InSAR.
3.2.
Velocity measurements using pixel offset tracking
Mapping the glacier surface velocity is crucial for characterizing ice dynamics and quan-
tifying glacier ice mass balance (Bindschadler and Scambos 1991; Joughin et al. 2002;
Rignot and Thomas 2002). In order to overcome the previously mentioned region-speciﬁc
limitation of InSAR in mapping glacier velocity, we took an alternative approach to monitor
glacier velocities utilizing sub-pixel offset tracking on nadir-viewing near infrared (NIR)
imagery from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reﬂection Radiometer
(ASTER). This technique utilizes cross-correlation between two images to estimate sur-
face velocities, details of which are illustrated in Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008).
Pixel offset tracking or sub-pixel correlation is a technique to measure the motion of spa-
tially coherent features through time between two images (Crippen 1992). In glaciology,
these features generally consist of crevasses, undulations, and moraines (Konig, Winther,
and Isaksson 2001). The horizontal displacement thus obtained can be used to generate
velocity maps utilizing the time difference between the images pairs. In this study, the
ENVI- and IDL-based processing software, Co-registration of Optically Sensed Images
and Correlation (COSI-Corr) (Leprince et al. 2007), is used for the said purpose. This
method has been successfully used for measuring glacier velocities such as those in Stearns,
Hamilton, and Reeh (2005), Howat et al. (2008), Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008),
Debella-Gilo and Kääb (2011), Herman, Anderson, and Leprince (2011), and Willis et al.
(2012). Initially, a DEM is used to generate approximate tie points for the master image,
and we used the same SRTM 3-arcsecond DEM with the voids ﬁlled by the CGIAR group
(Version 3) as described above. Tie points are then subjected to an optimization algo-
rithm in order to generate precise ground control points to orthorectify the master image.
Once the master image is orthorectiﬁed, ensuing slave images are orthorectiﬁed using
the same master image. After successful orthorectiﬁcation and co-registration of image
pairs, a correlation algorithm is then applied by moving the correlation windows across
the prepared images on a regular grid. Distinctive features are tracked between image
pairs and their displacement is calculated to produce displacement maps and their cor-
responding signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) maps. Note that the methodology implemented
here is exactly the same as that presented in Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008)
and is most appropriate for additional details on the methodology and functionality of
COSI-Corr.
In order to overcome the limitation of producing high quality velocity estimates from
InSAR, a sub-pixel correlation or offset tracking technique is employed on ASTER L1A
satellite imagery acquired for the region. Table 2 enlists the details of the ASTER L1A data
set analysed in this study. For better results, maximum care is taken to obtain images with
less snowfall and cloud cover, especially over the Gangotri glacier. In order to analyse the
motion over the entire length of the glacier, we acquired ASTER L1A data for two frames
covering the lower and upper reaches of the Gangotri glacier. Both frames were acquired on
the same date and with the same acquisition parameters but processed separately. Another
associated advantage of ASTER imagery over SAR imagery for such difﬁcult terrain is the

availability of the 3N (NIR) band with nadir-viewing geometry and 15 m spatial resolution,
thus minimizing topography-induced errors in the velocity estimates. The images used in
this study are mostly acquired during the month of October, which is the end of the melting
season.
3.3.
Uncertainty analysis
A number of factors contribute to uncertainties in the coherence-based estimates of glacier
retreat rate, including DEM, orbital, and baseline errors. Errors in velocity estimates
obtained using pixel offset tracking can again be attributed primarily to DEM errors, which
are transferred in the form of orthorectiﬁcation errors to the orthorectiﬁed master image.
The SRTM 3-arcsecond DEM that we used has voids ﬁlled by the CGIAR group (Version
3), so the DEM quality is variable. The voids in SRTM version 2 are extensive in the steep
slopes of the Himalayas. We chose ASTER pairs with the same look angle to minimize the
effects of DEM errors since both images have the same viewing geometry. Kääb (2002)
discussed these anomalies as a ground position error, which is about 3 m for moderately
inclined terrains.
Additionally, uncertainties from resampling and image cross-correlation processes are
generally much smaller than the pixel size of 15 m; hence, matches with uncertainties
greater than one pixel are usually discarded during the processing (Scherler, Leprince, and
Strecker 2008). The cumulative error in velocity estimates is less than 5 m year−1 for the
data sets used in this study. This error is estimated by computing surface velocity for loca-
tions where stable ground is exposed typically near the snout to keep other inﬂuencing
factors such as slope and surface conditions as close to the glacier as possible. Since surface
velocity should be ideally zero in these locations, any value other than zero is approximated
as the error. In order to quantify the error, we concentrated on velocities estimated for an
area in front of the snout (Figure 4(a) (Box 1)), which is observed to be ice-free in all of
the images used in this study. Analysis showed that velocities estimated in this study suffer

8659
from a possible bias (mean) of about 4.2 m year−1 and an error (standard deviation) of
about 2.3 m year−1. The high precision in the observed estimates can be attributed to sev-
eral factors such as (1) low cloud cover in the ASTER images, (2) the scenes are obtained
for the same time period (late summer and fall), which helped to eliminate errors related to
snowfall and changes in solar illumination, and (3) the time span between paired ASTER
images are mostly kept at nearly 1 year, which provides a resolvable time window to derive
glacier surface velocities.

Results
4.1.
Glacier recession from 2004–2010
Shown in Figures 2(a) and (b) are the InSAR coherence maps of the Gangotri glacier region
obtained from image pairs with the shortest possible acquisition intervals in order to locate
the snout of the glacier with improved accuracy. The detail of interferometric pairs chosen
to study short and long-term variations of the Gangotri glacier is shown in Table 1. For the
reasons stated above we present results from coherence mapping for Pair 1 (Figure 2(a)) and
Pair 6 (Figure 2(b)). Thus, it can be observed in Figures 2(a) and (b) that by stretching the
values in the coherence maps, the majority of the region registered low coherence, caused
mainly due to accumulation and ablation of snow and ice and also due to steep slopes.
However, regions near the northern ﬂank of the glacier show high coherence (>40%),
which is attributed to the fact that the snout of the glacier has retreated, exposing boulders
and moraines. Hence, these are the areas which show more relative stability over a consid-
erable period of time (typically a few months). Areas further down the valley are likewise
seasonally snow-free but have considerable vegetation (as evident in ASTER scenes, not
shown), which produces low coherence in the image. Thus, high coherence occurs only in
those areas recently exposed by glacial retreat and not yet covered by signiﬁcant vegetation
growth, i.e. only near the glacier snout.
See Table 3 for the snout positions obtained during the period of Pair 1 (2004–2005),
Pair 5, and Pair 6 (2009–2010). These results correlate very well with the snout posi-
tions reported in a previous study, using ground-based surveys (Kumar et al. 2008). The
colour code used in Figure 2(a) and (b) shows two dominant shades, blue representing low
coherence, which is quite apparent over this region since continuous snowfall and melting,
renders most of the region incoherent. The assumption made here is that the newly exposed
surface material adjacent to the snout of the glacier, deposited by continuous recession
of the terminus, should show coherence values well above 40% and is represented by red
zones near the northern ﬂank of the glacier in Figure 2(a) and (b). The average recession
rate of the Gangotri glacier for the period 2004–2010, based on the distance between the
two snout positions (along the central ﬂow line of the glacier), obtained from the coherence
maps (Table 3), is estimated to be 21.3 ± 3 m year−1.
The recession trend is indirectly linked to the glacier mass balance, which is the net
accumulation and ablation within a year measured as the difference between the amount
of snow accumulated in winter and ice removed by melting in summer. The coherence
maps computed from each of the pairs provide insight into the extent of ice-free surface
observed during the respective time periods. Hence, stacking each of these coherence maps
will highlight the area over which terminus retreat has occurred over the entire period of
2004–2010, yielding a holistic view of the ice-free area cleared by ice over the region cov-
ered by the Gangotri glacier and its tributaries. Figure 3 shows the colour-coded coherence
map obtained by stacking the coherence images from Pairs 1, 5, and 6. This represents

Glacier velocity measurements from 2005–2011
In this study, sub-pixel offset tracking analysis is performed on ASTER pairs, acquired
around the month of October during 2005–2006, 2009–2010, and 2010–2011, that covered
the entire Gangotri glacier in two frames. This enables a recent and periodic assessment of
Gangotri glacier dynamics. Figure 4 represents a cumulative analysis plot of the Gangotri
glacier motion. A Euclidean norm of the displacement measured in the north–south and
east–west direction for Pair 2 and Pair 4 (2009–2010), after mosaicking, is shown in
Figure 4(a). Large magnitudes of velocity are observed over the Gangotri glacier for both

pairs (indicated by bright red colour), with a maximum value of 40 ± 2.3 m year−1 in the
lower glacier (Pair 1) and 70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1 in the upper glacier (Pair 4). Considering
the time difference between the two concerned pairs, the velocity of the Gangotri glacier,
during this period, is estimated to be a maximum of 70.2 m year−1 near the head of the
glacier and less than 30 ± 2.3 m year−1 near the snout of the glacier. It is also evident from
Figure 4(a) that the Gangotri glacier recorded higher motion than the surrounding region of
steep mountain slopes, which had near zero net motion. A clear indication of glacier move-
ment is also apparent from the deﬁnite pattern of motion illustrated in the vector ﬁeld plot
shown in Figure 4(b). Streamlines of velocity vectors (shown in Figure 4(b)) clearly demar-
cate the glacier extent and illustrate the magnitude and direction of glacier ice motion.
In order to demonstrate, in greater detail, velocity variations within the Gangotri
glacier during the span of 2005–2011, glacier surface velocity along the central ﬂow line
of Gangotri (Figure 4(b)) is analysed for each of the images pairs (Table 2). Shown in
Figures 4(c) and (d) is the velocity versus distance curve drawn along the proﬁle line (Line
AB for Pairs 1, 2, and 3 and CD for Pair 4 and 5 in Figure 4(b)). As observed from the pro-
ﬁle plot for the lower reaches of Gangotri (Figure 4(c)), surface velocity variation is almost
similar for all the three pairs. However, the annual ﬂow rate for Pair 1 (2005–2006) is
comparatively lower than that of Pair 2 (2009–2010) and Pair 3 (2010–2011), particu-
larly near the snout and in the lower reaches of the glacier. In general, surface velocity
is larger at higher reaches of the glacier as compared to those near the lower reaches and
is likely dependent on variations in the glacier slope, width, and thickness. This pattern
is also evident from the proﬁle plot for higher reaches of the glacier (Figure 4(d) (also
see supplementary Figure S1 at http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2013.845923), where
the glacier mass velocity is considerably higher near the head of the Gangotri glacier, for
both the image pairs. While surface velocity near the snout, for all the time periods, varied
between 24.8 ± 2.3 to 28.9 ± 2.3 m year−1, velocities away from the snout varied between
a minimum of 13.9 ± 2.3 m year−1 to a maximum of 70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1 (in the upper
reaches of the glacier). The average velocity for the image pairs, 1, 2, and 3, are 28.1 ± 2.3,
27.9 ± 2.3, and 28.2 ± 2.3 m year−1, respectively, which is considerably lower than the
average velocities for Pair 4 and Pair 5, which are 45.7 ± 2.3 and 50.4 ± 2.3 m year−1,
respectively.

Discussion
Glacier surface velocity and retreat rate are two very important parameters that are used to
characterize glacier dynamics. This study has produced reliable estimates of both of these
parameters. The methodology involved the utilization of coherence mapping and image
stacking to locate and monitor snout movement as well as quantify the zone of melting
over a considerable time span. The observed snout positions between 2004 and 2010 are
commensurate with those observed in earlier studies. Gangotri glacier retreat rate observed
in this study is comparable to rates of 23 m year−1 (for 1985–2001) (Hasnain, Ahmad,
and Kumar 2004; Cruz et al. 2007), 17.15 m year−1 (1971–2004) (Raina 2009), 23.2 m
year−1 (for 1968–2001) (Bhambri, Bolch, and Chaujar 2011a, 2011b), and 19.9 m year−1
(for 1965–2006) (Bhambri, Bolch, and Chaujar 2012). The most recent estimate of glacier
retreat using the differential global positioning system (DGPS) and satellite imagery was
obtained to be 17.59 m year−1 for the period of 1976–2009 (Kumar, Areendran, and Rao
2009). Table 4 summarizes some of the most recently published retreat rates of the Gangotri
glacier. The retreat rate measured in this study corroborates well with most of the long-term

measurements, estimated over the past 70 years, which also establishes the efﬁcacy of the
methodology presented here. And perhaps most importantly, the results presented here indi-
cate that the most recent retreat rate of the Gangotri glacier conﬁrms a continuous retreat
of the glacier with a consistent rate taking into consideration multidecadal measurements.
The current study also addresses the phenomenon of temporal decorrelation and associ-
ated limitations of InSAR with longer time intervals for surface velocity measurements
and DEM generation for this particular region of the Eastern Himalayas. Sub-pixel offset
tracking, utilizing ASTER data, enabled high-resolution measurements of surface ice-mass
velocity, which is particularly relevant in difﬁcult mountainous terrains such as that of the
present study area (e.g. Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker 2008). A comprehensive analysis
of surface velocity of the Gangotri glacier is performed for the entire length, from snout to
the head, of the glacier. In general, the observed surface velocity variations of the Gangotri
glacier are comparatively similar for the entire range of image pairs (between 2005 and
2011) acquired for this study. However, the magnitude of glacier motion is typically low
for the period 2005–2006, which was also reported in Raina (2009). While the majority of
the incongruence amongst the spatial distribution of surface velocity is noted in the upper
reaches of the glacier, velocities near the snout are almost similar over all time periods. The
annual variations are high, which indicates fast motion of the Gangotri glacier, especially
during the period 2009–2011. These estimates are considerably higher than the short-term
estimates made by Kumar, Venkataraman, and Hogda (2011), Kumar et al. (2011), and
yearly estimates by Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker (2008). Such high surface velocities
may indicate that ice motion in this region is dominated by basal sliding in the ablation
zone of this relatively steep glacier. The velocities estimated here are based on cumula-
tive surface displacement experienced by the glacier over a period of 1 year. Hence, these
velocity estimates do not reﬂect on its seasonal variation. The surface velocity variations
are most comparable for Pairs 2 and 3. However, on average, surface velocity is observed
to be lower during 2005–2006 compared to 2010–2011. These year-to-year variations can
be attributed to factors such as variations in meteorological conditions (Singh et al. 2006)
and the amount of basal sliding (Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker 2008) over the years.
However, yearly differences in the amount of basal sliding due to the variation in melt
water ﬂux can be a contributory factor.
The current study has the potential to provide an integrated assessment of glacier ﬂow
dynamics, to complement previous and future studies in the area and to provide a key
methodology to delineate glacial lake formation (Quincey et al. 2007; Bolch et al. 2011),
which is of major concern in the Himalayan glaciers.

Conclusions
This study provides comprehensive characterization of the dynamics of the Gangotri glacier
in terms of retreat rate and surface velocity estimates over a continuous period from 2004 to
2010. We employed SAR interferometry to quantify the snout retreat of the Gangotri glacier
in the Himalayas, exploring its capabilities for an integrated assessment of the glacier.
Results showed that the Gangotri glacier, which is one of the largest Himalayan glaciers,
retreated about 119 m over a period of 6 years (2004–2010), at an average rate of 21.3 ± 3 m
year−1. In the context of previous studies, the rate has been almost the same for the last
couple of decades. The results also demonstrated that retreat rate of the terminus was not
uniform over the 6-year period. Further, stacking coherence images from different SAR
pairs delineated the area cleared by ice from 2004 to 2010, facilitating a broader idea about
melting of Gangotri and its tributary glaciers. Results from the sub-pixel offset tracking of
ASTER images revealed signiﬁcant motion along the length of the glacier and its tributaries
compared to the surrounding region, meanwhile establishing a better picture of ﬂow char-
acteristics of the Gangotri glacier. High velocities were observed at the upper reaches of the
glacier while comparatively less movement was observed near the snout. Speciﬁcally, while
the average glacier surface velocity was estimated to be about 36.1 ± 2.3 m year−1, over the
period 2005–2011, the maximum and minimum velocities ranged between 13.9 ± 2.3 and
70.2 ± 2.3 m year−1. Overall, variation of surface velocity of ice mass over the entire length
of the Gangotri glacier was approximately similar for all of the image pairs studied for the
period 2005–2011. While most previous studies suggest a decrease in retreat rate based on
observations made over short time period (e.g. Kumar et al. 2008), our study, which is based
on almost continuous measurements over a period of 6 years, suggests that the glacier is
melting at a constant rate, which is in accordance with long-term estimates measured since
1965. Such observations are useful in assessing the glacier’s response to climate change
and provide an avenue to understand glacier dynamics and its relation to glacier surface
morphology.
