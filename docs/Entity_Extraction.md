## Context and Scope
Entity extraction, often termed as Named Entity Recognition (NER), is a pivotal task in the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP). In the context of our project, the goal is to harness the power of advanced language models and tools to perform entity extraction and document-level coreference resolution on large volumes of data.

Entity extraction along with coreference resolution are pivotal in enhancing the understanding and processing of large textual datasets. These techniques enable us to identify, classify, and link entities, ensuring that the context and relationships within the text are preserved and understood.

In this document, I will introduce the workflow of our entity extraction system, which leverages data from cloud storage and employs advanced language models and tools for processing. The key components and actions of this system include:

- Data Retrieval

- Document-Level Coreference Resolution

- Extract Entities

By the end of this document, you will have a comprehensive understanding of our entity extraction system, its components, and its capabilities in processing and understanding vast textual datasets.
## Proposal
Our proposal presents a comprehensive system designed to handle data from diverse sources and extract entities with high accuracy. By integrating state-of-the-art tools and strategies, we aim to create a pipeline that not only extracts entities but also understands the context and relationships within the text. This foundation will be instrumental in our future endeavors, especially in constructing and analyzing entity relationship graphs.
Here's a breakdown of our proposed system:
