The impact of climate change on glaciers of the world has been a topic of active concern
in recent times (Syed et al. 2007; Bagla 2009; Cogley et al. 2010). While glacial melt is a
major source of freshwater that contributes to global mean sea level rise (Meier et al. 2007;
Jacob et al. 2012), decreasing glacial mass has an impact on the freshwater resources of
some of the largest river basins in the world, including that of the Ganges (e.g. Kumar,
Singh, and Sharma 2005; Mall et al. 2006; Immerzeel, van Beek, and Bierkens 2010;
Kaser, Grosshauser, and Marzeion 2010). Fluctuations in the recession rate of glaciers dur-
ing recent years have initiated widespread discussions, especially in the context of global
warming and its effects (Dyurgerov and Meier 2005). Similar ice mass changes have also
been reported in the Garhwal region of the Himalayas (Kulkarni et al. 2005; Bhambri,
Bolch, and Chaujar 2011a, 2011b; Kulkarni et al. 2011; Bolch et al. 2012). However, the

status of the Gangotri glacier warrants further investigation, particularly in the context of
climate change resulting in continuous retreat, negative mass balance, and early melting of
seasonal snow cover (Negi et al. 2012).
Glaciers cover about 40,800 km2 of the Himalayan and Karakoram mountain region,
and are one of the main sources of water to some of the largest rivers in the world, including
the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Indus (Kulkarni et al. 2011; Bajracharya and Shrestha 2011;
Bolch et al. 2012). Approximately 10% of the summer discharge of the Ganges is attributed
to melt waters from glaciers (Barnett, Adam, and Letternmaier 2005; Jain, Agarwal, and
Singh 2007; Immerzeel, van Beek, and Bierkens 2010; Bolch et al. 2012). Rapid depletion
of glaciers has had adverse effects on the flow regime of major Himalayan rivers, and can
even lead to catastrophic events such as glacial lake outbursts (Govindha 2010; Shrestha,
Eriksson, and Mool 2010; Ashraf, Naz, and Roohi 2012) and consequent flooding in the
upper reaches of these rivers, affecting the lives of millions of people residing in the Indo-
Gangetic plains (Richardson and Reynolds 2000; Bolch et al. 2012).
In spite of their hydrologic, climatic, and socioeconomic significance, opportunities for
precise and continuous monitoring of the Himalayan glaciers are limited by logistical and
terrain-induced difficulties. Observations of Earth’s surface using satellite data have proven
to be very useful in such monitoring; recent developments in high-resolution image acqui-
sition have facilitated more precise monitoring of glacier movement (Luckman, Quincey,
and Bevan 2007; Kumar, Venkataraman, and Hogda 2011; Kumar et al. 2011). Further,
satellite data enables a gross analysis of glacier mass budgets, overcoming some of the
problems of accessibility and sustainability of long-term measurements, that can later be
verified with ground-based surveys (Kumar et al. 2008). The potential of remote sensing
for glacier mass balance and velocity mapping has been demonstrated with optical (e.g.
Kääb 2005; Scherler, Leprince, and Strecker 2008), synthetic aperture radar (SAR) (e.g.
Luckman, Quincey, and Bevan 2007), and thermal infrared sensors (e.g. Nakawo, Yabuki,
and Sakai 1999), and elevation models (Bolch, Pieczonka, and Benn 2011), among others.
Developments in deriving flow rates and monitoring Himalayan glacier retreat using optical
images have been made by Kääb (2005). However, this approach is sometimes limited by
weather, clouds, and shadows in areas of high relief.
In a novel approach, the current study presents one of the most comprehensive assess-
ments of the Gangotri glacier in recent times (2004–2011). The methodology entails the
utilization of interferometric SAR (InSAR) coherence and sub-pixel offset tracking. While
complementing most previous studies, the result presented here establishes the effective-
ness of the techniques implemented to produce robust estimates of areal changes and glacier
surface velocity in near real time. But, perhaps most importantly, this is one of the few stud-
ies which has shown the melting trend of Gangotri glacier over a considerably continuous
period during recent times (2004–2011).
2. Study area
The Gangotri glacier is a valley-type glacier and one of the largest Himalayan glaciers
located in Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand, India (Figure 1). Extending between the lat-
itudes 30◦ 43 22 N–30◦ 55 49 N and longitudes 79◦ 4 41 E–79◦ 16 34 E, Gangotri
is the only major Himalayan glacier that flows towards the northwest. It spans a length
of 30.2 km, its width varies between 0.20 and 2.35 km, and it thereby covers an area of
about 86.32 km2 . While the average thickness of the Gangotri glacier is ∼200 m, its sur-
face elevation varies from 4000 to 7000 m above mean sea level (Jain 2008). Gangotri has
three main tributaries, namely the Raktvarna, the Chaturangi, and the Kirti, with lengthsInternational Journal of Remote Sensing

18 small tributary glaciers of Gangotri and its tributaries. Gangotri and other glaciers in
this region are mostly fed by the summer monsoon and partly by winter snow. Western
disturbances cause heavy snowfall from December to March over this region (Thayyen and
