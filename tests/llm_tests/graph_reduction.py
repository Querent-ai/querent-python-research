MORTON \nBureau of Economic Geology \nThe University of Texas at Austin \nAustin, Texas 78712 \nABSTRACT: Shoreline changes from sandy oceanic coasts worldwide show temporal and spatial variations \nthat are similar to, and exemplified by. composite data from the Texas coast for four time periods \nextending from 1850 to 1975. The quantitative data, which exhibit remarkably similar distributions \nfor the first two and latter two periods, show that both total length of eroding coast and rates of \nerosion have substantially increased since 1955-60. As a result, some shoreline segments that prograded \nfollowing sea-level stillstand are presently eroding. \nSpatial variations in shoreline changes occur on regional and local scales. Regional tendencies toward \naccretion or erosion closely correspond with physiographic provinces, which in Texas are defined \nby transgressive and regressive beaches and barriers. Within each province, rates of accretion and \nerosion display periodicities that are irregular to quasi-sinusoidal in form and are attributed to shoreline \nrhythms resulting from differential rates of sediment transport. \nNatural processes, such as decreases in sediment supply and continued relative sea-level rise are \nlargely responsible for long-term shoreline retreat. Short-term (historical) shoreline changes reflect \nthe long-term trends, but they also reflect secular sea-level variations and human activities. The latter, \nin the form of coastal engineering modifications, are clearly responsible for the highest short-term \nrates of accretion and erosion. \nOn the Texas coast nearly half of the total beach sand supplied by updrift erosion, presently a \nmajor sediment source, has been trapped by jetties at harbor entrances. This impoundment of sand \nat impermeable barriers together with reduced sediment influx from damming of rivers suggest that \nanthropogenic augmentation of natural shoreline erosion will likely increase from local to regional \neffects. \nINTRODUCTION \nSandy coastal areas of the world commonly \nexhibit temporal and spatial variations in \nshoreline changes. This study examines re- \ngional and local differences in shoreline \nmovement, their time-dependent variability, \nand their relationship to natural alterations \nin physical processes and subsequent evolu- \ntion of the Texas Gulf Coast during the past \nfew thousand years (Fig. 1). \nThe study is based on shoreline changes \ndetermined for the 590 km Texas Gulf Coast \nfrom topographic maps and aerial photo- \ngraphs spanning four time periods (see Mor- \nton, 1977a for previous work, quality of data, \noperational procedures, and possible sources \nof error). In spite of certain limitations, the \n~Manuscfipt received November 16, 1978; revised \nJune !, 1979. \n2Publication authorized by the Director, Bureau of \nEconomic Geology, The University of Texas at Austin. data are adequate for analyzing time-depen- \ndent variations in shoreline changes and for \ndemonstrating that not only has total length \nof eroding shoreline increased during the past \ntwo decades, but rates of shoreline erosion \nhave also increased significantly in some \nareas. Such accelerations suggest important, \nperhaps long-term alterations in coastal \nprocesses. \nRATES OF SHORELINE CHANGE \nSpatial Variations and Shoreline Rhythms \nRates of shoreline change for sandy \nbeaches worldwide exhibit distinct maxima \nand minima when data for individual time \nperiods are viewed laterally along the coast \n(Fig. 2). Except for protuberances--at tidal \ninlets, river mouths, and man-made chan- \nnels-patterns for variable rates are irregular \nto quasi-sinusoidal considering vertical exag- \ngeration of the graphs. Similar patterns have \nbeen illustrated by Edelman (1967), Valentin \n1102 ROBERT A.

(in press) and pre- \nsented in tabular form by Cocco (1976) among \nothers. Data from these studies and data for \nthe Texas coast show that some time-depen- \ndent oscillations are spaced 2.5 to 3 km apart \nand other oscillations have spacings of 5 to \n7 km. \nThe variable rates of change are related \nto beach processes and the formation of \nintermediate scale shoreline rhythms (see \nBajorunas and Duane, 1967; Dolan et al., \n1974; and Sonu, 1973, for review and refer- ences). The shoreline rhythms are manifested \nby accelerated and decelerated shoreline \nmovement in comparison to adjacent areas. \nApparently accelerated accretion or decel- \nerated erosion (Fig. 2) results from greater \nsediment storage, whereas decelerated \naccretion or accelerated erosion suggests \ngreater sediment transport. Many sandy \ncoasts are broadly arcuate with relatively \nsmooth shorelines along any given segment \nand this simplicity is maintained, at most \nsites, by compensating accelerations or \ndecelerations for subsequent time periods. \n""".replace("\n"," "))
